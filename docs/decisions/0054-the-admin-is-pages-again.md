# 0054 — The admin is pages again, and the editor is the only client left

Date: 2026-09-14
Status: accepted · replaces [0006](0006-admin-stays-react-spa.md)
In force: see the [index](README.md). The index is maintained; this file is not.

## Context

[0006](0006-admin-stays-react-spa.md) kept the admin as a React SPA during the port, and it was
right to. It also wrote down, in its own Consequences, the bill that this ADR is paying:

> **Cost accepted:** React idiom has a high ten-year mortality, so this code will need
> rewriting eventually. That is the right trade, because the cost of rewriting it later is
> falling faster than the risk of keeping it is rising.

Four things have moved since 2026-07-27.

**The deadline it was written under is discharged.** The port shipped at
[0012](0012-flatten-repo-after-cutover.md).

**The intent is now on the record.** [0053](0053-a-dependency-is-a-decision.md) makes writing it
here the default and a dependency the exception. React and the Tiptap wrapper are in its tier C.

**The harness 0006 asked for exists, and is four times the size it asked for.** That ADR made
the admin's lack of parity coverage a condition and required "a scripted headless tour of at
least 30 flows". `bun run tour` runs **127**, in a real browser, and asserts geometry and
contrast as well as behaviour. A screen-by-screen rewrite is measurable in a way it was not.

**The other half of the product already works this way.** The reading site is Hono rendering
HTML with small islands of plain JavaScript in `src/assets/js/`, and it has been since
[0008](0008-hand-written-css-no-tailwind-public.md). The admin being a different kind of program
means every rule about pages has two answers.

What is being carried:

| | |
|:--|:--|
| Admin TypeScript, tests and build output excluded | **29,509 lines** |
| `.tsx` components | **176** |
| Hook call sites | **731** (321 `useState`, 143 `useEffect`, 135 `useRef`, 64 `useCallback`, 40 `useMemo`) |
| JavaScript the owner's browser downloads | **2,420 KB** |
| API endpoints the admin calls | **51** |

## Decision

**The admin becomes server-rendered HTML with islands, the same shape as the reading site.
React and `react-dom` go. The editor stays a client-side application, on ProseMirror directly.**

Four things follow from that, and each is a decision in its own right.

**1. Navigation is the browser's again.** The client router goes and each admin screen becomes a
Hono route that renders HTML. Moving between screens is a page load. For a program one person
opens, that is not a regression — it is what the reading site does, and it removes the router,
the route-level code splitting and every loading state that exists only because navigation was
being simulated.

**2. The eleven admin dictionaries stop shipping.** They are translated strings picked at render
time, so the server picks them and the browser is sent one language: the words, already chosen,
inside the HTML. That alone is most of a megabyte.

**3. The editor is the exception, and stays one.** ProseMirror is an application, not a page, and
[the pen](0049-the-pen-answers-the-hand.md), the maths nodes, find-and-replace and the Markdown
bridge are all built on it. Only the wrapper leaves: `@tiptap/*` is a convenience layer over
ProseMirror, and 15 of this repository's import sites already reach through it to
`@tiptap/pm/*`, which IS ProseMirror re-exported.

**4. ProseMirror becomes a direct dependency, in tier B of [0053](0053-a-dependency-is-a-decision.md).**
It arrives today underneath Tiptap; after this it is named. That is an addition, so it is stated
here rather than made quietly: `prosemirror-state`, `-view`, `-model`, `-transform`, `-commands`,
`-keymap`, `-history`, `-inputrules`, `-schema-list`, `-dropcursor`, `-gapcursor`, `-tables`.
The reason it is an exception and not tier C is the one 0006 gave and that has not weakened in
seven weeks: **Vietnamese IME with Telex**, across four browsers, in the program its owner writes
in every day. `key-feedback.ts` already carries the scar tissue of handling one composition
event. ProseMirror is ten years of the rest.

### The order, and why it is this one

Cheapest first, and the editor last, so that the hardest screen is converted by someone who has
already converted fifteen others.

1. **The screens that are forms.** Settings, and the first-run steps. Mostly inputs that POST.
2. **The screens that are lists.** Posts, pages, notes, comments, subscribers, redirects.
3. **The library.** Uploads, with the one real island: the drop target and its progress.
4. **The dashboard and analytics.** Charts, which are islands over data the server already has.
5. **The editor.** Last, and on its own, and in two steps: `@tiptap/react` first (the three React
   node views become plain ProseMirror ones), then Tiptap itself.

⚠️ **THE LIBRARY MOVED TO THE END, WITH THE EDITOR.** `/admin/content` looks like step 2 and is
not: `pages/Content.tsx` is 43 lines of empty sheet, and the list on that screen is `WritePane`,
which the shell mounts for the library AND for all three editors so that clicking a row swaps
only the sheet. Converting the library alone would leave that one 399-line pane written twice —
once as HTML for `/admin/content`, once as React for `/admin/editor/*` — and two copies of the
same list is precisely the drift this ADR's markup rules exist to prevent. So the library, the
pane and the editors convert together, and the order above becomes 1, 2 (minus the library), 3,
4, then the library with 5. Decided 2026-09-14, after the assistant.

⚠️ **AND SETTINGS IS NOT STEP 1.** "Mostly inputs that POST" was a guess, and the survey says
otherwise: seven tabs over about 7,400 lines, TWO save protocols on one screen (a page-level
`PUT /api/settings` and a card-level partial of the same route) plus roughly thirty card-owned
endpoints, of which a dozen are irreversible or reach outside the machine. It also holds two
code editors with synced gutters, a palette grid of native colour pickers, a live type
specimen, a keystroke-sound synthesiser, three file dropzones — and three fields that open the
MEDIA PICKER, which the Media screen owns. So Media converts first and brings the picker with
it as the fourth bridge (`quire:pick-media`); Settings is the last screen before the editor.
Groundwork for it — the field vocabulary and the form's diff engine — is written and parked.

### What proves each step

- **The tour's flows for that screen stay green.** They are written against the rendered page and
  not against React, so they do not need rewriting to keep working. A flow that has to change to
  pass is a behaviour that changed, and that is the signal. It has fired once: the analytics
  piece index now sends every row and hides all but ten, so a flow that counted rows compared
  forty-one against forty-one. The behaviour that changed is real and intended — the whole index
  arrives in the first response — and the flow now counts what is VISIBLE
  ([`docs/admin-one-dom.md`](../admin-one-dom.md)). It has fired twice more, both on the
  assistant, and both are improvements the React shape was in the way of:
  - **A conversation is in the address** (`/admin/assistant?chat=12`). The React face opened a
    chat by id rather than routing to it, because a route change would have swapped the page
    component and taken the conversations column with it. There is no component to swap now, so
    what is left is what that cost: a reload lost the conversation you were reading, Back left
    the screen entirely, and switching chats mid-pause could send a verdict naming calls from
    the conversation you had just left.
  - **"New conversation" no longer inserts a row.** It posted a chat the moment it was pressed,
    so pressing it three times left three empty conversations in the list and in the database.
    It is a link to the bare address; a question already opens a chat for itself when there is
    none.

### Settings, and the two rules it forced

**All seven panels ship drawn, and here that is load-bearing.** The Save key stores the WHOLE
form: an owner changes the blog's name on one tab, the front page's shape on another and a
palette on a third, and presses Save once. Drawing one tab and navigating between them would
make every switch a page load, and a page load with unsaved work either loses it or raises the
browser's own two-button warning. Measured: **554 KB of markup, 49 KB gzipped** (the app
brotli-compresses its own HTML, so the wire figure is lower again), 244 controls, 7 panels, 112
search rows. Appearance is 210 KB of the 554 on its own.

**There is no copy of the settings in the page.** What a field WAS is what the browser already
holds for it — `defaultValue` on an input, the `selected` attribute on an option, `data-was` on
the three kinds of control that have neither. So the unsaved count is exact and sixty-three
settings keys do not ride into the browser twice.

⚠️ **THE THREE-WAY LEAVE QUESTION SURVIVED, and it is a fix rather than a port.** This document's
own trap 3 says a converted screen's links are real navigations, so leaving a dirty form would
have raised the browser's generic warning — two buttons, neither of which can save — on the one
screen where leaving without saving throws work away. The island catches the click itself and
asks the product's own question; `beforeunload` stays underneath it for the ways out a click
handler cannot see.

**Six bugs the conversion found, four of which would have saved the wrong thing silently:**

- An **emptied number field** sent `0`. "Posts per page" to none, "upload limit" to zero bytes.
- **Array-shaped keys** (`menu`, `featured`, `home.front.strips`) built objects, so `menu.0.label`
  sent `{menu:{0:{label}}}` and `sanitizeMenu` — which walks an array — stored nothing.
- **A boolean behind a segmented strip** (`figure.ink`) sent the string, and `bool()` discarded it.
- ⚠️ **A hidden field could never look changed.** `input[type=hidden]` keeps `value` and
  `defaultValue` in lockstep, so five settings — both logos, the portrait, `enabledPalettes`,
  `customFont` — would have been chosen in the picker, drawn on screen, and not sent. This is why
  `hiddenField()` writes `data-was` and why a test asserts every hidden field has one.
- **`enabledPalettes` failed in the worst direction**: `sanitizeEnabledPalettes` reads a non-array
  as "turn all six on", so sending the string would have switched on palettes the owner had
  switched off.
- **One switch drawn on two tabs.** The comments master switch is on Posts and on Comments & mail
  — React drew one component twice over one piece of state. Two independent controls do not stay
  in step, so the island mirrors them and the count counts KEYS rather than controls.

**And six more that only a photograph found.** Each one type-checked, passed the suite and the
tour, and would have shipped. They were caught by running the new build and the React build side
by side on one seeded database and comparing the screens by their text, by every element's
computed box, and finally pixel for pixel — which is a check that stops being available the day
the React build is deleted, so what it found is written here and pinned by tests.

- ⚠️ **A LAMP WRAPPER THAT LOST ITS `flex` MADE EVERY CARD WITH A LAMP 7px TALLER.** Without it
  the wrapper is a block holding an inline-block, so it takes a 24px line box for an 8px mark.
  Twenty-two cards on one screen, half of them with lamps, and the header heights no longer
  agreed. Nothing in the markup is wrong to read; it is only wrong to measure.
- **Every select lost its chevron.** The control sets `appearance-none`, which takes the
  platform's own caret away, and the replacement was written as `<svg data-glyph="down"></svg>`
  — an attribute that means something only inside a `Mark` tree. In raw markup nothing fills it,
  so the svg was empty and a dropdown looked exactly like a text box.
- **A slider's readout dropped its unit.** The server printed "60%" from a string the caller
  passed; the island rewrote the box from `value` + `data-unit` and printed "60". Two renderers,
  two answers; `slider()` takes the unit now and both read it.
- **The SMTP card said "Loading..." forever.** It is the one card on the screen whose values are
  not in the site record — they sit behind `GET /api/mail` — and nothing was ever written to ask.
  Every stored SMTP field was invisible on the screen whose job is showing them, and the only
  symptom was a word that is supposed to be brief.
- **Two lamps read grey where they should read amber.** Grey is "switched off", which is a
  settled state somebody chose. A connection with no credentials has no switch, so the only
  thing off could mean there is "never set up" — something to do. React defaulted `enabled` to
  true for exactly this reason.
- **A number field holding one digit was 380px wide,** because the caller asked for the full
  column. A short answer sits in a short field: the width of a field is a claim about how much
  belongs in it.

**Three differences are deliberate, and they are the whole list.** A conversion that changes how
a screen reads is hiding a decision inside a move, so every other difference above was closed:

1. A segmented strip's explanation now sits ABOVE the strip, where every other row in the admin
   has always put it. React made the strip the exception; five rows on Home and Posts move.
2. "Looks like" appears once — as the card's title — where React drew it as the title AND as the
   control's label.
3. The site-language select takes the same width as the timezone select beside it, where React
   sized it to its content. Two dropdowns in one card at two widths was the older answer.

The timezone list also lost its 26 `Etc/GMT±N` entries. In those names the sign is INVERTED
against every other way a person writes an offset — `Etc/GMT+1` is UTC minus one hour — and they
are in the database for POSIX compatibility. The browser leaves them out of `supportedValuesOf`
and this list was the browser's until it moved to the server, where the engine hands back all
26. A stored zone the runtime does not offer is now prepended to its own control, because a
`<select>` whose value matches no option silently shows its first one instead.

### The write column, and the one number this ADR paid for it

The library, the column and the editors were always one conversion (see the correction above).
This step did the first two thirds: `/admin/content` and the three editor addresses became
server-drawn frames — rail, write column, sheet — with React still drawing what went IN the
sheet. `WritePane.tsx` and its six helpers are gone. The last third followed on the same day:
the sheet is markup too, `<div id="admin">` is back beside the canvas where it belongs, and
`data-admin-react` is gone with the routes that needed it.

⚠️ **A ROW CLICK IS A REAL NAVIGATION NOW, and here is what that cost.** Measured 2026-09-15,
two builds on one seeded database, click to the writing surface:

| | old (React) | new |
|---|---|---|
| the write list itself | 79 ms | **85 ms** |
| opening a post, first time | 346 ms | **373 ms** |
| opening the next post | **12 ms** | 373 ms |

So the list is unchanged and the first open is unchanged; what went is the warm click. It went
because the column was mounted outside the router precisely so it would survive one, and
nothing survives a page load. 373ms was also the TRANSITIONAL number: almost all of it was
React and Tiptap booting from nothing on every open, and step 5 removed it — **107ms to a
writing surface**, measured the same way, on the same seeded database
([`../admin-conversion.md`](../admin-conversion.md)).

⚠️ **AND A MEASUREMENT THAT WAS WRONG BY 2.1 SECONDS.** The first reading said 2,512 ms, which
would have been a reason to stop. It was the PROBE's own `sleep(2500)` before evaluating: a
harness that waits and then asks the page for `performance.now()` is told how long it waited,
whatever the page did. Every resource had finished by 571ms. A measurement that cannot say what
it is measuring is worth less than no measurement, because it gets acted on.

**What the column gives back, and how.** Scroll position, the search text and the three filters
are in `sessionStorage` — per tab, cleared with the tab, never told to the server. They are put
back after the filters are applied, because the scroll height depends on how many rows show.

**Two faults this screen taught, both about counting rather than drawing:**

- ⚠️ **TWO MECHANISMS DECIDING ONE `display` IS ONE TOO MANY.** The first cut left kind, status
  and "what is missing" to CSS rules against attributes on the column and kept only the search
  in the island. It DREW correctly and could not COUNT — `shown` was the number of rows that
  passed the search, so a filter hiding all forty-six still reported forty-six and the "nothing
  matches your filter" line never appeared. Found by diffing against the React build, which said
  the sentence. One mechanism now: `hidden`, written by the island, and by the server for the
  one filter that arrives in the address.
- **A lamp in a plain span takes a line box.** 16px of it for an 8px mark, which grew the filter
  row by 8px. The same fault cost every settings card 7px of header height in the step before
  this one. There the fix was `flex` on the wrapper; here it was not having a wrapper — the
  attribute goes on the lamp.

**The drawers had no check at all before this.** `TaxonomyManager.tsx` and `SeriesManager.tsx`
had no unit test and no flow, while driving the most far-reaching pair of writes in the admin:
renaming a category rewrites the front matter of every post carrying it and merges on collision.
Two flows now — one that opens both, counts what they list, and proves the rename ASKS; one that
reorders a series and proves the server kept it.

### The editor: its log is a file of its own

Step 5 is the long one, so what each piece cost and what it found is in
[`../admin-conversion.md`](../admin-conversion.md) rather than here. The decision is above; that
file is the record of carrying it out — the three node views, the React adapter, the button
strip, the menus, the find strip, the Markdown view and finally the sheet around the paper, and
the faults each one turned up.

**Decision 3 held.** ProseMirror is still an application and is still built in TypeScript: the
button strip, the bubble bar, the "/" menu and the find strip are assembled at runtime, and so
are the calendar's forty-two cells and the time machine's rows, because all three are lists that
change and none of them could honestly be shipped drawn. Everything AROUND the writing arrives
as HTML. The line between the two turned out to be easy to state and worth stating: markup is
what a state can be drawn in, and an application is what has to be computed to exist.

### Step 6: the last of React, and the four things that belong to no screen

The fourteen screens converted one at a time and left React routing ONE page — the dead end — and
holding four things that are not screens at all: the command palette, the shortcut sheet, the
confirm dialog and the toast. Those are markup the server draws on every admin page now
([`src/web/admin/overlays.ts`](../../src/web/admin/overlays.ts)), wired by five files the rail
island imports before its own early return, because three of them are asked for by screens that
have nothing to do with the rail — including the sign-in shell, which draws no rail at all.

`react`, `react-dom` and their two type packages are out of `package.json`, `jsx` is out of the
admin's tsconfig, and **what the browser must have before the first frame went from 297 KB to
22 KB**.

### Step 7: the wrapper leaves, and the editor is this product's own

Nine `@tiptap/*` packages out; a schema, a plugin stack, a keymap, a table of input rules, a
command table and a small `Editor` class in `src/admin/editor/`. **The editor chunk went from
1,028 KB to 524 KB** and the admin's JavaScript from 1,170 to 776 — 102 plugins became 15.

What made it survivable is that the serializer never depended on the wrapper: `md/to-editor.ts`
and `md/from-editor.ts` speak node names, not an API. **45 corpus fixtures produce byte-identical
Markdown through both editors**, and the schema was proved equal field by field against a running
Tiptap editor — 310 assertions — before the packages went, with the answer kept as
`golden/editor/schema-before-step-7.json` so the comparison outlives them.

Both steps, what each cost and the faults each turned up, are in
[`../admin-no-framework.md`](../admin-no-framework.md).

### The fourth bridge: `quire:pick-media`

The first one that answers back. The picker is an overlay island now
([`src/admin/island/lib/media-picker.ts`](../../src/admin/island/lib/media-picker.ts)), opened
by anything that needs a picture — the three editors and two settings cards, all still React —
through a `CustomEvent` carrying the words to say and a callback to answer on. The rail island
is on every admin page and imports the overlay only when that event arrives, so a page that
never opens a picker never downloads one. An unheard ask resolves to "closed", which is the same
rule the confirm bridge follows: nothing happens rather than something unasked-for.

It replaces a `<MediaLibrary mode="picker">` mounted at six call sites, and it arrives with three
things that component never had: `role="dialog"`, Escape, and the focus put back where it came
from.

### One description, two renderers

The assistant is the first screen whose markup is produced twice: by the server for a stored
conversation, and by the island for one still arriving over the wire. Written twice they drift,
and the transcript then reads as two different screens depending on whether you reloaded.

So the SHAPE is data ([`src/admin-shared/markup.ts`](../../src/admin-shared/markup.ts)) and the
two renderers are about twenty lines each: `htmlOf` escapes into a string, `elOf` builds nodes
and sets text as text. Neither can inject markup, because neither is ever handed any — they are
given a tree that already says what every element is.
[`src/admin/island/mark-agreement.test.ts`](../../src/admin/island/mark-agreement.test.ts) holds
them to the same answer, through one serializer, for every state an exchange can be in.
- **`check:admin-css` keeps every class honest**, which is what makes moving markup between files
  safe at all.
- **The editor's own suites**: 2,074 lines and 122 blocks, including the corpus round trip whose
  second law is that a save may not change the reader's page.
- **Telex, by hand, before the editor step ships.** No harness here reaches an IME. This is a
  condition, not a suggestion.

## Consequences

- **The admin stops being a second kind of program.** One way to render a page, one way to write
  an island, one set of conventions.
- **Roughly 2 MB stops being downloaded**, most of it dictionaries and the framework. This does
  not matter for speed on the owner's machine and was never the argument; it matters because it
  is 2 MB of somebody else's decisions.
- **This is the largest single change since the port**, and it is the one with the most ways to
  be quietly wrong. It is deliberately cut into steps that each ship — five screens-and-chrome
  steps as written, then a sixth for the framework itself, which the ADR folded into the others
  and which turned out to be its own piece of work: the four overlays belong to no screen, so
  nothing converted them on the way past.
- ⚠️ **A DRAWN-AND-HIDDEN OVERLAY ON EVERY PAGE CHANGES WHAT A TEST CAN SEE.** React mounted one
  when something opened it, so `querySelector('[role=dialog]')` could only find the one that was
  open; four ship on every page now. Ten flows went red for that one reason and an eleventh went
  quietly green. It is trap 4 of [`../admin-one-dom.md`](../admin-one-dom.md) arriving on the
  chrome rather than on a list, and it will arrive again on anything else that ships drawn.
- **`@tiptap/*` leaves; `prosemirror-*` arrives.** The count of packages barely moves — nine out,
  twelve in. The point is which layer this project depends on: the wrapper has a commercial tier
  and a company behind it, and the engine underneath is MIT, one author, and older than this
  product. ✅ **Done 2026-09-15.** And the prediction about the count held: 22 packages declared
  where there were 31, because `react`, `react-dom` and their types went in the same week.
- ⚠️ **A WRAPPER THAT WRAPS TWENTY EXTENSIONS SHIPS TWENTY EXTENSIONS.** The ADR said payload was
  not the argument, and it was not — but the editor chunk halved. What was actually being paid
  for was an extension system: each extension contributed its own keymap plugin and its own
  input-rules plugin, so the editor mounted 102 plugins and a keystroke walked most of them.
- **0006's parity concern outlives it.** The admin is still the area a type error cannot see.
  The tour is the answer, and every step of this owes it a flow.
