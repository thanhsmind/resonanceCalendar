## For the people building it

Everything here describes how Quire Ink works **right now**. Out of date here is a bug: fix
it in place, in the same commit as the behaviour change that made it wrong.

What does not belong here: anything dated (that is a snapshot, not a document), anything
about what we intend to do, and any rule already stated somewhere else. Snapshots and intent
are not in this repository at all
([ADR 0017](decisions/0017-move-state-and-instance-config-private.md)); `check:docs` fails on
a dated filename in this directory.

One rule lives in exactly ONE file. `CLAUDE.md` is a router and restates nothing, because two
copies of a rule means one is wrong within a month
([ADR 0010](decisions/0010-four-homes-doc-layout.md)).

## How it is built

`spec/` was written before and during the rewrite from Next.js + PostgreSQL to Bun + Hono +
SQLite. Where a spec disagrees with the code, **the code won**; the four marked **reference**
held up and are the working account.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| [spec/00-rationale.md](spec/00-rationale.md) | Why 2.0 exists, the non-goals, the numbered parity exceptions, the risks taken |
| [spec/01-schema.md](spec/01-schema.md) | The SQLite schema as it stands: conventions, every table, the migration ledger. **Reference** |
| [spec/01-schema-port.md](spec/01-schema-port.md) | What the Postgres features became: the array columns, the `tsvector` search, the six SQL functions |
| [spec/02-structure.md](spec/02-structure.md) | Module layout, request flow, the seven invariants in full. **Reference** |
| [spec/03-golden.md](spec/03-golden.md) | The rendering contract: fixtures, capture, and what a diff means |
| [spec/04-frontend.md](spec/04-frontend.md) | Server-rendered HTML, the island model, the CSS split. **Reference** |
| [spec/06-auth.md](spec/06-auth.md) | Password + TOTP + recovery codes, sessions, the cookie. **Reference** |
| [spec/07-parity-public.md](spec/07-parity-public.md) | Every reader-facing 1.x behaviour, with the fragile ones marked. The defence against silent feature loss, since the golden harness only sees public HTML |
| [spec/07-parity-admin.md](spec/07-parity-admin.md) | The same for the admin, editor, settings, MCP, operations and auth, none of which the harness sees at all |

## Why it is this way

[decisions/](decisions/README.md) — ADRs, append-only, with an index saying which are still
in force. Going against something already decided starts by reading that index.
