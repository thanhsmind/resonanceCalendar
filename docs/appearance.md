Quire Ink ships **one design**. There are no themes to install, which is a deliberate
trade — a theme gallery is a promise to keep every theme working forever, and the ones
that stop being maintained are the ones people are running. What replaces it is a set of
knobs, and this page is the map of them, ending with the escape hatch for anything they do
not cover.

## The knobs, roughly in the order they change a first impression

| Setting | Where | What moves |
|---|---|---|
| Homepage mode | Home & menu → Front page | A list of posts, a single page you wrote, or a composed front page. This is the single largest visual difference between two Quire Ink blogs ([homepage.md](homepage.md)) |
| Logo | Blog → Logo and icons | An image mark instead of the site name. In practice this is the first thing a reader tells two blogs apart by; it is resized for you and never served at its original weight |
| Palette | Appearance → Appearance | Six built-in palettes, and every one of the seven colours in each is editable in both light and dark |
| Reading font | Appearance → Font | Four built-in faces, or upload your own (`.woff2`, up to four weights). Fonts are served from your own server — nothing is fetched from Google |
| Chrome font | Appearance → Font | The face used by the header, the rail and the small print, separately from the one your words are set in |
| Type scale | Appearance → Text sizes | Nine roles, each with size, line height and letter spacing |
| **Density** | Appearance → Shape | How much air between everything. `normal` is the design as drawn |
| **Corner radius** | Appearance → Shape | Square, soft, or round. Avatars and pills keep their own shape |
| **Headline weight** | Appearance → Shape | Light, normal or bold. Moves the post title and the card title together |
| **Tables** | Posts → Tables | Seven knobs for how a table is drawn: header row, which lines, line weight, banded rows, first column, cell padding, and what happens on a phone. **The header row is tinted by default** — see below |
| **Post hero** | Posts → Pictures | Whether a post's own picture appears above the headline. **Off by default** — see below |
| **List thumbnail** | Home & menu → Post list | Whether that picture appears on list rows, as a small square or a large 3:2. **Off by default** — see below |
| Figure frame | Posts → Pictures | The frame every in-body picture wears unless it says otherwise |
| Content width | Home & menu → Layout & menu | How wide the reading column runs |
| Sidebar | Home & menu → Layout & menu | One rail or two, and whether there is a rail at all. Switching it off leaves the rail carrying the owner's MENU alone: that switch owns the discovery blocks, never the site's navigation |
| Archive in the sidebar | Home & menu → Post list | The years, as a block in the rail. Separate from the `/archive` PAGE switch — the block can leave while the page stays reachable |
| Series in the sidebar | Home & menu → Post list | The series list, each linking to its own page |
| Tags in the sidebar | Home & menu → Post list | The tag cloud. The one block in the rail with no ceiling on its length, which is why it sits last |
| Categories in the sidebar | Home & menu → Post list | The categories, each with how many posts it holds |
| **Read without a signal** | Posts → What is on a post | A post your reader has already opened still opens with no network. **Off by default.** Nothing is downloaded ahead of time and your admin is never stored. Turning it off again removes it from readers who already have it |
| **Archive** | Home & menu → Post list | `/archive`: every post you have published, grouped by year, and the list of years in the rail. **On by default.** If you already publish a page or a post at `/archive`, yours keeps the URL and this stays off until you move it |
| **Author** | Blog → Author | Name, bio, portrait and a link. Empty by default; filling in a name adds a byline and puts you in the structured data search engines read |
| Motion | Account → This admin | Every transition, entrance and smooth scroll, on the site, the sign-in page and the admin alike. A reader's own reduced-motion preference wins either way ([conventions/motion.md](conventions/motion.md)) |
| Looks like | Appearance → Looks like | Which of four dialects the published site wears: **Plain paper** (nothing added), **Source code**, **Newspaper** or **Notebook**. Asked once, as the last step of setup, and one click either way here afterwards. Only the published site: this admin never changes. Newspaper is the one that touches your words — it numbers headings, figures and tables, and those numbers live on the page and not in the feed, the newsletter or what a reader copies. Source code sets your headlines in its monospace and numbers the lines of a highlighted code block, which a copy does not pick up |
| Footer | Home & menu → Footer | Your own line, with `{year}` and `{title}` tokens |
| **The reader's pen** | Posts → What is on a post | Readers select words on a post and highlight, underline, ring or note them; marks live in their browser only and are drawn with the site's own pen. **On by default.** Off removes the bar and leaves the quote-copy gesture ([ADR 0043](decisions/0043-the-reader-gets-a-pen.md)) |
| **Hand-drawn lists** | Posts → What is on a post | Bullets become ink dots and level dashes, and a numbered list counts in a handwritten numeral (Kalam, ten digits, 1.4 KB). **On by default.** Off restores the browser's disc and decimal; a list that starts past 1 and a task list keep the browser's marker either way |
| Feature switches | Posts → What is on a post | Table of contents, progress bar, book mode, related posts, reading time, the scroll fade, and a dozen more |

**Two of those read differently on a phone, and neither is a setting.** The reading-progress
bar is desktop-only: the scrollbar already answers how far in you are, and a scroll-driven
hairline stutters on a phone because it shares the compositor with the address bar
collapsing. And book mode below 640px is one scrolled column rather than a turned spread —
a modal dialog takes the scroll off the document, which is what keeps iOS from retracting
its own bars, so the phone reader scrolls the page and its chrome hides on the way down.

### About the table settings

⚠️ **This is the one settings group whose default does not reproduce what your blog looked
like before it existed.** Every other group in this product shipped defaults that moved
nothing on upgrade. A `<th>` had no ground of its own — a header row was bold text in the
same paper as the data, and read as one more row — so a default that preserved it would have
preserved the complaint. **To get exactly the old rendering back: Header row → Plain, and
Lines → Around every cell.** Nothing else in the group changes anything by default.

One set for the whole blog, and that is deliberate rather than a limitation. Markdown has no
syntax for a tinted header, a row rule or a bold first column, so the only way to make a
table differ from the table below it would be an attribute carried inside the source — and
then a table you paste in is no longer a table you can paste out. These tables are written by
pasting Markdown in, so they stay plain GFM.

| Knob | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Header row** | **Tinted** (default) · Plain · Ruled — no ground, a heavier line beneath · Inverted — the ink and the paper swapped |
| **Lines** | **Around every cell** (default) · Between rows only · None. A table of numbers reads well boxed; a table of sentences drowns in it |
| **Line weight** | **Hairline** (default) · Thick |
| **Banded rows** | **Off** (default) · On — a faint tint on every other row. It earns its place on a long table, not on four |
| **First column** | **Same as the rest** (default) · Emphasised — for a table whose left column names the row and the rest answers it |
| **Cell padding** | Compact · **Normal** (default) · Relaxed |
| **On a narrow screen** | **Squeeze to fit** (default) · Scroll sideways |

**What "Scroll sideways" is for.** A table of sentences keeps compressing its columns until
they are a word wide, and the sideways scroll the reading column has always had for wide
tables never engages, because a table that can shrink never overflows. Measured on a phone at
375px: a two-column reference table put its first column at 105px, made one row 551px tall,
and ran to 2,334px with no scrollbar anywhere. Giving each cell a floor makes it scroll
instead. It is a choice and not a fix, because the same floor would send a timeline of three
short columns sideways when it fits a phone comfortably today.

**Every ground is mixed from your palette, never named.** The header wash is 6% of your text
colour stirred into your page colour, so it darkens the paper in a light theme and lightens
it in a dark one, in all six palettes, from one declaration. Measured on the default
palette: page and header are 13 steps of grey apart in light mode and 12 in dark, which is a
band you can see without being told it is there.

### About the picture settings

They arrived switched **off**, on purpose. A blog that upgraded into the version that added
them kept the exact pages it had; nothing grew a picture without being asked. The list offers **three** answers and the article **two**, and neither asks about shape:

| Where | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Cover on the post** | Not shown · **Show it** — a 3:2 cover above the headline, the width of the reading column |
| **Thumbnail in lists** | Not shown · **Small square** beside the words, with the text wrapping under it · **Large 3:2** above the title |

The shapes are fixed on purpose. One blog's pictures should look like one blog's pictures,
and picking that is the design's job rather than a question put to you three times. It also
removes the case that makes covers look accidental: an ordinary portrait scan is 963px tall
inside a 672px column, a whole screen of picture between the headline and the first
sentence.

There is no full-bleed cover either — the table of contents and the info panel sit eight
pixels from the reading column, so a wider picture prints over them.

Posts without a picture are unaffected either way — there is no placeholder, and there
will not be one.

If you want pictures on your homepage **and** the ordinary list layout, `thumb` is the
setting you want. The newspaper homepage mode is a different answer to the same wish, with
a different shape.

## When the knobs are not enough: your own CSS

**Appearance → Custom CSS** is injected into every public page, last, after
everything else — so it wins. It is not filtered: any rule you can write in a stylesheet
works here. It never touches the admin, so you cannot lock yourself out with it.

The box counts its lines, indents on Tab, and shows the byte count — this text travels inside
every public page on every request, so it is worth seeing. It also tells you when a brace is
unclosed, which is the usual reason a stylesheet does nothing at all: braces inside comments
and strings are not counted, so it does not cry wolf.

The design is built on CSS variables, and overriding a variable is almost always better
than overriding a rule: a variable is a value the whole design already reads, so changing
one stays consistent, while a rule you copy out of the stylesheet is a copy that stops
matching when the original changes.

### The variables that are safe to set

These names are part of what the software promises you. They will not be renamed without a
note in the changelog. Since 2026-08-31 `check:contract` fails the build if this list and
`src/content/appearance-contract.ts` disagree in either direction.

**You do not have to come here for them.** The Custom CSS box lists every name below, with
one line of explanation each; clicking one writes it where your cursor is.

```css
:root {
  /* Colour — every one of these already changes with the palette, so set them only
     when you want something the six palettes do not offer. */
  --c-bg:      #fcfcfc;  /* page background */
  --c-text:    #2e2e2e;  /* body text */
  --c-heading: #121212;  /* headings */
  --c-meta:    #6d6d6d;  /* dates, counts, small print */
  --c-link:    #121212;  /* links */
  --c-accent:  #121212;  /* the one accent: active states, markers */
  --c-rule:    #ebebeb;  /* hairlines and dividers */

  /* Shape */
  --radius:      .5rem;  /* corner radius (Shape sets this; override for a value between) */
  --fw-title:    700;    /* the archive heading's weight */
  --fw-heading:  600;    /* the post title, card titles and every bold label */
  --density:     1;      /* multiplies every gap; Shape sets .82 / 1 / 1.22 */

  /* Measure */
  --shell-w:      672px; /* the reading column (Content width sets this) */
  --sp:           1rem;  /* the spacing unit every gap is a multiple of */

  /* Type — nine roles; each has -fs- (size), -lh- (line height), -ls- (letter spacing) */
  --fs-h1: 2rem;  --lh-h1: 1.15;  --ls-h1: -0.01em;
  --fs-body: 1.13rem;  --lh-body: 1.7;  --ls-body: 0em;
  /* ...and the same trio for h2, h3, h4, small, caption, code, ui */

  /* Motion */
  --dur-fast: .15s;  --dur-base: .2s;  --dur-slow: .5s;  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.3,1);
}
```

**Dark mode.** Set a variable on `:root` and it applies in both schemes. To change only one,
scope it:

```css
:root[data-scheme="dark"] { --c-bg: #0b0b0c; }
```

### The class names that are safe to target

Structure that is part of the contract, in the order a page uses it:

| Class | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.wrap` | The page shell |
| `header.site` / `footer.site` | The site header and footer |
| `.rail` | The sidebar, and the drawer it becomes on a phone |
| `.post-list` / `.post-list article` | The list of posts, and one row of it |
| `.card-thumb` | A list row's picture, when thumbnails are on |
| `.post-hero` | The picture at the top of an article |
| `.prose` | The article body — everything you wrote lives inside this |
| `.deck` | The standfirst under a post title |
| `.author-box` | The author box under an article |
| `.related` / `.read-next-title` | The blocks at the end of an article |
| `.arc-jump` / `.arc-yr` | The archive's row of years, and one year's block of rows |
| `.subscribe-card` | The newsletter sign-up |
| `#comments` | The comment tree |

Anything not on this list is internal. It may still work, and it may change in a release
without a note — if you find yourself needing one of those, that is worth telling us,
because it usually means a knob is missing.

### Two things to know before you write any

- **The page cache holds rendered HTML.** A CSS change appears immediately (the stylesheet is
  assembled per request from your settings), but a change to *markup* — which custom CSS
  cannot make — would not. This is why the design is driven by variables and attributes
  rather than by classes baked into stored pages.
- **`!important` is almost never needed.** Your CSS is already last. If a rule is not taking,
  the usual cause is specificity inside your own selector, not the design fighting you.

## When it is not CSS you need: your own code

**Server & connections → Site settings** holds your own HTML. One box goes in the page `<head>`, where
most snippets ask to be; the other goes just before `</body>`, where Cloudflare's beacon and
a few others ask to be. Both ship on every public page, in the order you typed them, and
neither is checked or rewritten — a box whose purpose is to carry a script cannot strip
script tags.

This is the seam between two different promises. Quire Ink itself makes **no third-party
request of any kind**, and that stays true: a fresh install has both boxes empty and fetches
nothing from anybody. What you put in them is your site's business, not the software's —
Umami, Plausible, a verification tag, a widget, a beacon.

Three things worth knowing before you paste:

- **It never reaches the admin, the sign-in page, or a draft preview.** A tracker on the
  preview of an unpublished post reports a reader who does not exist, and quietly spoils the
  numbers you read in Analytics.
- **Your content policy decides whether it runs.** The app itself sends no
  `Content-Security-Policy`, because a useful policy depends on what you have chosen to
  load. The proxy in front of it usually does: the nginx vhost in
  [self-host.md](self-host.md) and the `Caddyfile` (which `deploy/caddy/setup.sh` installs)
  both send `script-src 'self'`, which blocks both an inline `<script>` and a `<script src>` from
  another host, and the browser says so only in its console. Before a snippet can run
  under that policy, widen `script-src` (and `connect-src`, for a beacon that posts back)
  to name the host it loads from, the way the Turnstile block in the `Caddyfile` does.
  A `docker compose up` with no proxy of your own sends no policy at all, and the snippet
  runs as pasted.
- **The box shows the byte count**, for the same reason the CSS box does: that text travels
  inside every public page on every request. It also says when a `<script>` or `<style>` is
  never closed, which is this field's version of the unclosed brace — worse, because an
  unclosed `<script>` swallows the rest of the page and the site goes blank with nothing
  saying why.

The built-in statistics are not replaced by any of this. They stay where they are, they keep
their whole history, and they cost a reader nothing ([performance.md](performance.md)).

## What you cannot change from here

Honest list, so you do not spend an evening trying:

- **The order of blocks on the composed front page.** It is a designed layout with options,
  not a block builder ([ADR 0014](decisions/0014-homepage-modes.md)).
- **The article's three-column geometry.** The rail is positioned so the reading column stays
  centred; moving the article off-centre is a layout rewrite, not a setting.
- **Fonts fetched from a third party.** Uploading a face is supported; loading one from
  Google's servers is not, and the site's own content policy blocks it
  ([conventions/type.md](conventions/type.md)).
- **A seventh palette.** You can repaint all six; you cannot add one.
- **Per-post appearance.** Settings are site-wide by design. A single post can override its
  figure frame and gallery shape from the image fragment, and nothing else.
