# Admin surfaces

## Trash (soft delete) — Admin → Trash (`/admin/trash`)

- **Every delete is a soft delete.** `posts`/`pages`/`media`/`files` each have a nullable
  `deleted_at` (NULL = live, timestamp = trashed). `deleteX()` sets `deleted_at`; nothing is
  hard-deleted on a normal delete. EVERY live read filters `.is('deleted_at', null)`
  (index/search/getPost, page index/getPage, media/file lists, the finalize sweeps) so trashed
  items leave the site, lists, search, sitemap/feed/llms and the libraries at once.
- **The way IN is the editor's Attributes panel** (`screens/sheet-frame.ts` draws it,
  `island/lib/sheet-errands.ts` acts on it), beside History and View post, and only for a saved
  piece. It went missing 2026-08-17 to 2026-08-30: the old content table's row actions carried the
  trash icon and the `DELETE /api/{posts,pages}/:slug` behind it, and neither was rebuilt when the
  Write screen became two panes (`b4459b4`). Thirteen days and four releases with `/admin/trash`
  reachable and no way to put anything in it, reported from outside as issue #60. **Every tour
  flow that touched the trash called the endpoint directly**, which is why 2,100 green tests and
  a 61-flow tour all missed it; one clicks the control now. The confirmation says the piece can
  be brought back, because this delete is soft: `confirmDeletePost`/`confirmDeletePage` had said
  it could not be undone, which was never true of this endpoint.
- **Media/file soft delete KEEPS the blob** — a published post linking a trashed image keeps
  rendering; the blob is removed only on purge. So `/api/media/delete` no longer purges the page
  cache (it used to). A trashed row **keeps its slug** (still reserved via `ensureSlugFree`) so
  restore never collides.
- **Purge-in-use guard:** a media `purge`/`empty` first checks `usedMediaKeys()` (posts + pages +
  revisions + settings); if any target image is still referenced it returns `in_use:<n>` (409) and
  the island re-asks with a stronger confirm, retrying with `force:true`. Stops a purge silently
  breaking a live page.
- Per kind the lib exports `restoreX`, `purgeX` (hard delete: row + revisions/blobs), `getTrashedX`,
  `emptyXTrash`. `screens/trash.ts` draws all seven lists and `island/trash.ts` acts via **`POST /api/trash`**
  `{ kind, action: restore|purge|empty, ids? }` (owner-gated) then reloads, which is why the kind is in the
  address as `?tab=media`: a kind held only in the page put the owner back on Posts after emptying the picture
  trash. **Nothing auto-purges.** Restore and purge are writes like any other, so each clears the whole page
  cache (Invariant 1).
- **100 rows of the open kind at a time** (`TRASH_PAGE`) with the shared `pager()` under it and the page in the address. The tab counts stay the whole kind, because a bulk delete is how this screen gets big and "how many" is what it is opened for; sliced in the screen rather than in SQL, since seven exact counts mean the read is whole anyway.
- Adding a mutating trash action → log it (activity actions `*.restore` / `*.purge` /
  `trash.empty`) and keep the i18n keys in sync.

## Admin Help — `/admin/help`, `HelpGuide` + `HelpSections` + `HelpTables`

- The in-admin manual. **Body copy is ENGLISH by design** (it mirrors the repo docs, which are
  canonical); only the nav label + page title come from `adminT`. It is a lazily loaded route in
  the admin's own bundle like any other, so a reader of the public site never fetches it.
- Shape: a numbered **first-five-minutes** path (the order a new blog is actually set up in, each
  step a link), a **jump index** of chips, the reference **sections**, then two lookup **tables**.
  The index is kept in the same order the sections render, so a chip's position predicts where it
  lands.
- Sections are laid out in **CSS columns, not a grid**: the cards differ wildly in height and a
  grid aligns rows, leaving a dead gap under every short one. Each `Anchor` carries
  `break-inside-avoid` so a card is never sliced across the column break.
- The tables are the reason the page is worth opening: **Markdown** (the syntax beyond CommonMark —
  callouts, footnotes, embeds) and **Troubleshooting** (symptom → fix, e.g. the 465-vs-587 TLS pair
  that produces an opaque OpenSSL "wrong version number", and Cloudflare caching HTML so a reader
  cannot refresh a stale page away).
- `screens/help.ts` draws it, `admin-shared/help.ts` holds the content. The first screen registered with
  `island: null`: the only interactive thing on it is an index of `#` links.
- **Adding a feature? Add it here too** — the page is the only place a non-technical owner learns it exists.

## Admin UI kit — `src/admin-shared/kit.ts` and `src/web/admin/kit.ts`

- ONE source of truth for shared admin chrome so no page hand-rolls its own (radius /
  padding / shadow / header size used to drift): `Card` (canonical `CARD` surface, plus a
  `panel` mode for a card living INSIDE a sheet), `PageHeader`, `Tabs` (`lg` underline +
  `sm` segments, with a `dense` modifier), `StatCard`, `EmptyState`, and table tokens
  (`TableFrame` / `THEAD` / `TROW`). The one-sheet page itself lives in
  `admin-shared/kit.ts` — `SHEET`, `SHEET_TOP`, `SHEET_FOOT`, `SHEET_TOOL` —
  with `.paper-cols` (two newspaper columns) in `admin.css`; see "One sheet per page" in
  `docs/admin-design.md`. Admin is monochrome plus the product's own PEN BOX, and each ink
  keeps the meaning it has on paper: highlighter marks where you are (the rail's current row,
  the active tab) and search hits; red ballpoint dresses what destroys something and nothing
  else. A selected VALUE is not a place, so it stays on the ink pill — `where-you-are.test.ts`
  fails a chooser that reaches for the highlighter. The kit uses the neutral scale, not public
  theme tokens.
- **Admin canvas:** `<main>` in the admin layout carries `.admin-canvas` (`src/admin/admin.css`) — a flat,
  quiet neutral surface (one fill per light/dark mode); the sidebar + cards sit on solid surfaces
  above it. (The editorial redesign replaced the old dotted-grid canvas — see
  `docs/admin-design.md`.)
- **Sidebar (`AdminSidebar`):** four destinations + "Everything else" (which remembers an
  explicit open/close across sessions) by default; the owner can drag any row between the
  three zones, hide the wordmark and the search button, and the order follows them between
  machines as a site setting (`src/content/nav-order.ts`, [admin-design.md](../admin-design.md)). Two registers that must not dress alike: nav rows
  wear `SIDEBAR_NAV`, the footer's CONTROLS (theme, Clear cache, Sign out) wear the
  smaller `SIDEBAR_UTIL`. The collapse/expand control sits at the TOP next to the
  wordmark (a compact chrome button, NOT a nav row) so it can't be mistaken for Sign out;
  Sign out sits alone under its own divider. The "Show icons" switch (bottom of
  Everything else) governs the whole rail's glyphs. Palette selection was REMOVED from
  the admin chrome — it lives on the public site now; the admin only toggles light/dark,
  and that menu opens upward inside the rail (the rail carries `z-30`: `sticky` makes it
  a stacking context the content would otherwise paint over).

## The Write screen (Admin → content)

- `/admin/content` IS the two-pane Write screen (ADR 0024; the Writing Desk mock): the
  write pane — one stream of posts and pages, most recently touched first — beside an
  empty sheet inviting the next piece. Opening a row swaps the sheet for that piece's
  editor; the pane rides along on both editor pages from 1640px up (measured, `screens/content-pane.ts`).
- `screens/content-pane.ts` draws it, `island/content.ts` owns the stream: title+terms filtering, the
  debounced body search (`/api/admin/search`, hits and passage marked with the pen, accents
  folded one way only — typed WITH them they are meant, `src/accent.ts`), and two filters
  that STACK — a kind row (All · Posts · Pages · Notes, words on a hairline, the pane's own
  short `scope*` strings measured to one line in all eleven languages) and, on the small-print
  line under it, two status lamps (Drafts, Published: press one to keep only those, press it
  again for everything; the lamp is the one each row wears) beside the sort cycle
  (last-updated / date-created). They were one segmented row of six until 2026-09-09, and
  six segments in 288px broke their labels over two lines in every language. The date beside
  "Published" is the PUBLICATION date; a draft's only honest date is its save.
- **A PAGE OF ROWS AT A TIME** (`WRITE_PAGE`, `src/admin-shared/write.ts`): the server draws the
  first hundred and ships the rest `hidden`; the island reveals another hundred as the foot of the
  list scrolls in. A REVEAL, not a fetch — every piece stays in the page, so search, filters and
  sort remain node moves and the box still reaches a piece six hundred rows down. The limit is
  inside `applyAll` (one reason per hidden row) and its count is how many MATCH, not how many show.
- Taxonomy and Series open as right-hand `SlideOver`s from the pane's tool line —
  `TaxonomyManager`: rename (merge) / remove terms across all posts → `updateTerm`.

## Activity log + Overview (Admin)

- **Activity log:** every mutating route calls `logActivity(action, detail)` (post/page CRUD,
  media/file/icon/font, settings, taxonomy, cache.clear, backup.*). Gated by
  `features.activityLog`. Admin → Log (`getActivity`, latest 200 newest-first, Clear).
  **Adding a mutating route → log it too.** The frozen tree wrapped these in Next's `after()`;
  there is no equivalent here and none is needed — the promise is simply not awaited and the
  runtime keeps running.
- **Retention (hourly tick):** `sweepActivityLog()` drops entries older than a year and, past
  a ceiling of 20,000 rows, trims the REFUSED SIGN-INS first and only then anything else. The
  order is the point: refused sign-ins are written whatever the toggle says (a trail a setting
  can silence is one an attacker can silence), so a plain oldest-first trim would let anybody
  push the owner's own history out of the log one slow guess at a time. The table also travels
  whole inside every backup.
- **Error log (same table):** `errorHandler()` in `src/web/api.ts` — the one handler every route
  falls through to — calls `logActivityError("METHOD /path", message)`, recording an
  `error`-action entry (gated by the same toggle). So unexpected server failures show up in the
  log, rendered as the inverted (ink-on-ink) chip by `screens/log.ts` — the admin is
  monochrome, so "error" is the one chip printed in reverse. Only genuine errors land here
  (validation 400s use `fail()`).
- **Overview (`screens/dashboard.ts`, data from `src/web/admin/views-home.ts`):** the admin home, in the
  owner's question order ([ADR 0024](../decisions/0024-the-admin-is-rebuilt-around-writing.md) step 6,
  [admin-design.md](../admin-design.md)). A header with a **New post** action, a first-run checklist
  that takes itself off once done, the **Traffic** strip full width (30-day views, visitors, dwell,
  read-through, sparkline), then **Pick up where you left off** (`recentPieces` in `screens/recent-pieces.ts`: the
  four newest unfinished pieces, each opening the editor), then a 2×2 from `screens/dashboard-cards.ts`: **Needs
  attention** (published posts with no excerpt or no share image, each row a filter into the write pane), **Most
  viewed**, **Sources** and **Recent activity** (gated by `features.activityLog`). The five counts (Posts / Pages /
  Comments / Images / Storage) come LAST as a `statBand` (`web/admin/kit-figures.ts`), then the system line.
- **The editorial redesign** removed the old home-page duplicate cards (SEO health, traffic sources,
  quick-actions row, taxonomy breakdown, and the rich system panel) — that data lives on its own pages
  now; only the compact footer remains. See `docs/admin-design.md`.
- **Analytics:** Admin → Analytics (24h/7d/30d/1y). The **overview** shows five headline metrics — views, visitors (with
  **period-over-period trend** + a **new-vs-returning** split), **avg time on page** (dwell), avg
  read depth, and **one page only** (the share of readers who never opened a second page) — a **dual-series time chart** (views
  + visitors, an SVG in `screens/analytics-kit.ts`; the year range buckets by month, 24h by hour), a **top
  pages** table (each row links to its drill-down), **sources** (traffic **channels**
  Direct/Search/Social/Referral + top external referrers), **audience** (countries + **device /
  browser / OS**), and the **read-depth distribution**. Referrers/countries/channels/facets count
  **distinct visitors** (one person = 1, not page views). **Per-page drill-down** (`?path=`,
  `AnalyticsPageDetail`) repeats the trend + sources + depth for a single URL. (A **CSV export** of
  the daily series sat in the page header until 2026-08-30. It went because nobody wanted the file:
  a chart is the artefact here, and a two-column dump of it is not.)
  - **Every piece, not the busiest ten** (`PieceIndex`, 2026-08-30). The top-pages table stays the
    screen's default face — it answers "what is doing well" — and underneath it sits the complete
    index: one row per post and page, filterable, each linking to that piece's drill-down. Until it
    existed the ONLY door into a piece's own figures was a row in the top ten, so the fortieth piece
    could not be looked at even though its screen and its numbers were already built. Deliberately
    unranked and **uncapped** (a "top 50" would put the same wall one row lower); capped in HEIGHT
    only. Pieces with no views in the window are listed at zero — read by nobody is an answer — which
    is why `pieces` is joined to `titles` on the client rather than on the server. There is a second
    door in the editor itself (the panel's header line), on the same condition as View post.
  - **Left quickly** — on the drill-down, the share of measured leaves that were a glance: under ten
    seconds, **or** under a quarter read (`QUICK_MS` / `QUICK_DEPTH`, the latter deliberately the
    same boundary as the first bar of the read-depth split, so two numbers on one screen cannot
    disagree). It never shows without the sample count beside it, exactly as Delivery's bytes do:
    a leave sample exists only when the browser delivered the beacon, so the denominator is not the
    view count.
    ⚠️ **The beacon used to drop the entire bounce cohort.** `depth()` is 0 on a long article nobody
    scrolled, and the leave beacon refused to send at depth 0 — so a reader who arrived, looked and
    left in four seconds sent no sample, while everyone who stayed long enough to scroll sent one.
    Every figure drawn from `analytics_scroll` was therefore an average over the people who did NOT
    bounce: **average time on page and average read depth both read high, by construction.** Fixed
    2026-08-30 (`src/assets/js/track.ts`). Both averages fall on any install after the fix, and the
    lower numbers are the true ones; rows recorded before it are still missing that cohort, which is
    what the sample count beside the share is there to expose.
  - **Right now:** a live strip under the range tabs — distinct visitors over the trailing five
    minutes and the pages they are on (`getRightNow`, polled every 10 s via
    `/api/admin/view/analytics-now`; the poll pauses while the tab is hidden). No socket: the flush
    buffer holds writes for at most 2 s, so one indexed five-minute scan is already honest to real
    time.
  - **Timezone:** time buckets are truncated in the site's zone — **Settings → Blog →
    Timezone**, falling back to the `ANALYTICS_TZ` variable and then to UTC — so "days" line
    up with local midnight rather than with UTC. Since 2026-08-22 that one setting is the
    whole site's clock and not just this chart's: it also decides the date printed under
    every post, which until then was read off the SERVER's timezone and therefore changed
    if the site moved machine. The daily
    series emits **every bucket, zeros included** — a quiet day is a point on the chart, not a gap.
  - **The window is whole days, aligned to that zone** (`windowStart`), so a 30-day range is
    thirty full columns rather than thirty-one with a sliver at the left. The LAST column is
    still partial, and that one is honest: today is not over. The **previous-period** comparison
    uses the same elapsed length, so a part-finished today is not measured against a whole
    yesterday.
  - **Three numbers were wrong until 2026-08-30**, all found by reading the queries against
    what their labels claim:
    - **One page only** asked `count(*) = 1` — one EVENT, not one page — so a reader who
      reloaded a post was dropped from the count. Now `count(distinct path) = 1`. It remains a
      share of VISITORS over the window, not of sessions: there are none in this schema.
    - **Channels double-counted.** The beacon sends a referrer only when it is EXTERNAL, so every
      page after the first writes `referrer_host = NULL` and `channelOf(null)` is `direct`.
      Anyone who arrived from somewhere and read one more post was in that channel AND in Direct.
      A bare row now speaks only for a visitor with no external referrer anywhere in the window.
    - **`0s` and `0%` for a page never measured.** `TopPage.avgDepth` / `avgDwellMs` are `null`
      with no sample and the table prints an em-dash. This became load-bearing with the beacon
      fix: an unscrolled leave now records depth 0, so zero is a real reading and cannot also
      mean "no reading".
    - Ordering gained a name tiebreak everywhere (`order by … desc, path|country|name`), so rows
      on equal counts stop reshuffling between loads.
  - **Tablets, which the user agent cannot describe.** iPadOS 13+ identifies as Macintosh
    Safari on purpose, so until 2026-08-30 every iPad counted as a desktop Mac. Multi-touch is
    the whole of the difference and it exists only in the browser, so the view beacon sends
    `touch` and `parseUa` reads a touching **macOS** agent as `tablet` / **iPadOS**. Gated on
    macOS deliberately: a Windows touchscreen laptop is a desktop and its string says so.
    Nothing new is stored, and tablets appear gradually as the old bundle falls out of caches.
  - **Why the two screens do not show the same fifth number** (decided 2026-08-31). The overview
    ends its headline band with **One page only**; the per-page drill-down ends its with **Left
    quickly**. They answer different questions and belong where they are: a site asks whether
    readers go on to something else, a post asks whether they stayed on the thing in front of
    them. The overview's number was called "Bounce rate" until that date, which was a term
    borrowed from a metric this schema cannot compute — bounce rate elsewhere means a
    single-page SESSION, and there are no sessions here — and its resemblance to "Left quickly"
    two clicks away was the whole of the confusion. `leftQuickly` takes `path | null` and would
    work site-wide unchanged; it is deliberately not shown there, because a sixth headline
    number costs more than it explains.
  - **Referrer hosts are folded for display** (`canonicalHost`): plumbing labels (`www.`, `m.`,
    `l.`, `lm.`, `out.`, `away.`, …) peel off, so `l.facebook.com` and `m.facebook.com` count as one
    `facebook.com` row — folded on the (host, visitor) pairs, so one person through two doors is
    still one visitor. Identity subdomains (`news.google.com`) survive; the stored rows keep the
    raw host.
  - **Audience** columns (`device`/`browser`/`os`) are **coarse UA buckets** parsed at insert
    (`src/analytics/ua.ts`) — the raw user-agent is never stored, so no fingerprint (same stance as
    the salted visitor hash). **Dwell** = ENGAGED ms on the page, metered by
    `src/assets/js/track.ts` alongside the scroll depth: the clock runs only while the tab is
    visible and the reader has scrolled, typed or moved within the last three minutes, and the
    aggregates clamp every stored sample at 30 minutes (`DWELL_CAP_MS`) so the wall-clock samples
    recorded before the meter existed cannot drag the average — one forgotten 24-hour tab was worth
    ~3 minutes of "average time on page" on a real instance.
  - **Delivery** (2026-08-29) answers what a blog costs to serve, and both halves are labelled
    for what they are NOT. **Page weight** is `analytics_scroll.bytes`: the reader's own browser
    sums `transferSize` across Navigation and Resource Timing and sends it on the LEAVE beacon,
    beside the dwell, because a view row is written while the page's fonts and pictures are still
    arriving. It is READER bytes and never server egress — a bot, a feed reader and anyone with
    JavaScript off download bytes and report none, and a CDN answers most requests without the
    origin hearing about them. NULL means not measured and is reported as such: the panel always
    shows the denominator, because `bytes` is null on every sample older than the column, on
    browsers with no Navigation Timing, and whenever `features.transferStats` is off. Clamped to
    64 MB in `recordScroll`, since the route is an open POST. **Page cache** is `cacheStats` in
    `src/server/cache.ts`, counted at the one line in `web/listing-page.ts` that decides hit from
    miss, in memory and since boot: persisting it would mean a write on the read path, on the one
    path that file exists to keep cheap. It measures the IN-PROCESS cache and only for requests
    that got past the CDN, so a blog can read low here and still be served almost entirely from
    the edge; the edge's own rate is not visible from inside the origin at all.
  - `analytics.db` gained a migration ledger on the same day, and it needed one:
    `create table if not exists` cannot add a column to a table that already exists. Steps live in
    `src/store/migrations-analytics.sql` and run through the same `applyMigrations` the content
    database uses. `src/store/schema-analytics.sql` still states the final shape, so a fresh
    install has every section without running a step. The engagement / channel / audience /
    drill-down queries live in `src/analytics/` (`summary.ts`, `aggregate.ts`, `channel.ts`,
    `page.ts`).

## The assistant (Admin → Assistant) — `src/server/assistant.ts`, `src/web/admin/assistant.ts`

- **What:** a chat box in the admin whose every ability is a tool from
  [`src/mcp/registry.ts`](../mcp.md) — the SAME surface an MCP client gets. Somebody with a
  Claude subscription connects over MCP and never needs this; somebody who put an API key in
  Settings → Server & connections gets the same steward without leaving the admin.
- **One list, two doors, one rulebook.** The assistant cannot do anything MCP cannot, by
  construction: it holds no private tool, so a tool absent from the registry (the newsletter
  broadcast, token minting) is absent from both doors at once. That is what keeps the security
  story reviewable, and `registry.test.ts` pins the forbidden names at the registry level.
- **The loop is small on purpose:** at most 8 tool rounds per message, and **every argument is
  validated against the tool's own zod schema before the handler runs** — a model's JSON is a
  guess, not a contract. Results are truncated before they ride back.
- **Conversations are kept** ([ADR 0040](../decisions/0040-the-assistant-keeps-its-conversations.md)):
  `assistant_chats`, listed beside the chat the way the writing screen lists pieces, and carried
  in the backup. Deleting one is a delete, not a trip to the Trash.
- **Storage is not memory.** The model still gets a WINDOW of the conversation, capped where it
  was (`POST /api/assistant`, owner-gated, at most 60 turns). Short memory, no web access, and
  as clever as the model the owner chose.
- **The screen says what it costs.** Each answer carries what the exchange spent, and the top
  row carries the CONTEXT: how big the conversation has become, which is what the next question
  will be charged for again rather than a running total. Past 60k it turns amber, because that
  is the point at which starting a fresh conversation is the cheaper answer.
- **The rail follows the key.** With a model configured the assistant moves out of "Everything
  else" and sits under Home; with none it stays behind the fold, because a door onto a refusal
  has no business taking a quarter of the rail.
- **It is the owner acting.** Tools run on the server under the owner's session and are logged
  like every other admin action, and deletes go to the Trash.
- **Eleven actions STOP and wait for a click** (`server/assistant-consent.ts`): the five deletes,
  `compose_homepage`, `update_settings`, `update_appearance`, `send_test_newsletter`,
  `import_images`, `add_media_from_url`. The loop halts before running any of them and hands the
  call and its arguments back; nothing happens until Allow or Don't is pressed, and a refusal is
  written in as that call's result so the model moves on instead of asking again. The line is not
  "writes" — creating a post is a write and nobody wants to approve one; it is what an owner would
  want to have seen coming. A gate that asks too often teaches people to press Allow unread.
- **After it reads comments, every change asks.** `list_comments` is marked `untrusted`: its rows
  are readers' words, and a "rewrite this post" among them is not the owner speaking. From then
  on every tool that is not read-only stops for a click, the pause says why, and reads stay free.
- **The AI card asks about ONE job, not three.** Alt text and excerpts follow the key and were
  decisions about nothing; both settings still exist by name (`ai.altText`, `ai.excerpt`) for
  anyone who wants them off. **The comment guard keeps its switch**: it is the one job that sends
  a READER'S words to a third party, which is somebody else's data and not a thing to start by
  default.

## The admin on a phone, and on a phone that folds

The owner's readers write from phones, so this is measured rather than assumed. Audited
2026-08-28 at seven widths — 344 (Galaxy Z Fold, shut) · 360 · 390 · 412 (Z Flip, open) ·
673 (Z Fold, open, upright) · 768 · 841 (Z Fold, open, turned) — across twelve admin screens,
for three faults: anything past the viewport, anything clipped by an ancestor that hides its
overflow, and any hit area under a fingertip. Before: 8 screens overflowed, 24 controls were
clipped, 26 kinds of control were under 32px. After: **0 · 2 · 23**, and the two that remain
are a scroll container behaving as one.

- **A segmented track SCROLLS, it does not clip** (`SEGMENT_TRACK`). `overflow-hidden` makes a
  box a scroll container that no finger can move — script and focus can, a user cannot. Five
  of the eight Settings tabs of the time sat past the edge at 390px, reachable only by
  typing a `?tab=` URL. Its items also carry `shrink-0 whitespace-nowrap`, or a
  squeezed strip wraps its labels instead of scrolling — "Search & URLs" broke over three
  lines and made a 32px control 130px tall.
- **`min-w-0` on the Settings columns** (`COL`). A grid item defaults to `min-width: auto` and
  refuses to shrink below its content's intrinsic minimum, so the Layout tab pushed the page
  160px sideways at 344px and took the fixed Save bar off the edge with it. One declaration,
  every tab at exactly 0.
- **The rail waits for `lg` (1024), not `md` (768)** — [admin-navigation.md](../admin-navigation.md) has the measurement.
  It cost 208px of a 768px screen, which made unfolding a phone a step backwards: a Z Fold
  open and upright gave a form all 673px, and the same device turned to landscape gave it 633.
- **A table in the writing sheet scrolls on its own wrapper**, not by panning the whole sheet:
  the reader's rule moves the prose, which is right for a page you read and wrong for one you
  are typing into.
- **Controls are ROUNDED in the admin**, on the kit's radius scale
  ([admin-design.md](../admin-design.md)). Three screens had hand-rolled their own square
  chooser (`border px-3 py-2`) instead of using the kit's segmented track; they now use it,
  which is also three fewer copies of a control the kit already owns.

## Settings (Admin → settings) — `screens/settings-shell.ts`

- **ONE form, SEVEN tabs grouped by the owner's question** (`blog | home | post | appearance |
  people | server | account`; tab state not persisted, but `?tab=` deep-links, and the eight
  old ids still resolve to whichever tab holds those keys). Each tab prints its question under
  itself — [ADR 0041](../decisions/0041-settings-by-the-owners-question.md) is the argument,
  superseding the grouping in [0011](../decisions/0011-settings-regrouped-into-seven.md). The
  sheet's Save stores every ordinary settings key waiting on the screen and names how many
  (one `useState<SiteSettings>` → one PUT `/api/settings`); the cards on the last three tabs
  own their keys as well and each carries its own key, because a card that reaches an SMTP
  host or a Cloudflare zone TESTS what it just stored, which no page-level key can do.
- **The AI card** (Server & connections) — the provider (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / DeepSeek), the key, the model, and which jobs
  the model does on its own: `ai.altText` (describe an uploaded image), `ai.excerpt` (write the
  excerpt when a post publishes with the field blank), `ai.commentGuard` (hold spam in the
  Trash — NOTE: this one sends a READER'S comment text to the configured provider, which the
  other two jobs never do; the toggle says so in the UI, and an owner who enables it should
  say so in their privacy policy). **The key is the master switch**: with none stored, every job is off whatever its own
  toggle says. A text-only MODEL greys `ai.altText` and says why, because that job is the only
  one that shows the model a picture — and seeing is a property of the model, not the
  provider: DeepSeek sells both kinds under one key. Like the other credentials it is written and never read back. The model list is
  the provider's own, with a measured default per provider (`DEFAULT_MODELS` in
  `src/server/ai-provider.ts`).
- **Footer is owner-editable** (Home & menu tab): `settings.footer` is limited inline markdown
  (`src/render/inline-md.ts` — **bold / italic / underline / link** only, escape-first like
  `comment-md`, link hrefs protocol-checked) authored in `footer()` of `settings-home.ts` (textarea + B/I/U/Link
  toolbar + live preview). `{year}`/`{title}` tokens expand at render. The public layout renders it
  in `<footer class="site-footer">`; default keeps the "© {year} {title} · powered by Quire Ink" line.
- Cards per tab, each tab composed by its own `screens/settings-<tab>.ts` (two columns; a
  `panelCard` saves with the sheet, a `connectionCard` also posts to its own route): **Blog**
  (`settings-blog.ts`) general, the canonical address, branding, author; **Home & menu**
  (`settings-home.ts`) layout + menu + featured, footer, the composed front (only when
  `home.mode=front`), listing (with the list thumbnail); **Posts** (`settings-post.ts`) one card
  of four groups (head, body, end — with the comments switch — and reach), pictures (hero,
  figure, gallery), tables, inks; **Appearance** `lookPicker` (**Looks like**, four drawn tiles
  → `settings.look`, first: the coarsest decision) + shape + `palettes` (**Default appearance**,
  then the grid) left, fonts / font upload / custom CSS right, type sizes full width under
  both; **Comments & mail** (`settings-people.ts`) the comments switch again, comment keys,
  newsletter SMTP; **Server & connections** `siteCard` (crawlers + custom code), Cloudflare,
  redirects, import, `installCard` (cache, updates, storage), AI, MCP, API, ActivityPub, backups, off-site; **Account**
  security, then **This admin**: the **Dashboard** switch (`settings.dashboard.systemLine`), the
  activity log, and rendering (font smoothing, **Motion** → `settings.motion.enabled`, **Key
  feedback** → `motion.keys` / `keyVolume`, the pen squeak, the autosave interval).
  Every credential on those cards is written to the server and never read back, which is why they
  show status rather than values. `src/admin-shared/settings-index.ts` (⌘⇧K's index) reaches them all.
  `McpFields` is the EXCEPTION to "no own state/save": the MCP enable toggle flows through the
  settings form, but its token manager has its own `/api/mcp/tokens` API (plaintext shown once).
- **Palette is FRONTEND-ONLY now** — the admin chrome no longer carries a `PaletteToggle` (only the
  light/dark toggle). The Appearance tab still sets the site's **default palette** + which palettes
  readers may switch between (`settings.enabledPalettes`), with a note (`themeAdminNote`) explaining
  this. The DEFAULT palette (`themePreset`) is always shown (its checkbox is locked) so the set is
  never empty. The frozen tree filtered a public `PaletteToggle` through
  `enabledPaletteOptions()`; 2.0's equivalent is the header control in `assets/js/theme.ts`
  (`palette()`, ported 2026-08-11), which renders only when two or more are enabled and reads its
  ids and translated names off the button rather than from a bundled table. It ignores a stored
  palette that is no longer enabled, falling back to the default, because that palette's CSS is no
  longer emitted. Disabled palettes stay fully editable — visibility ≠ customization. Sanitizer
  (`sanitizeEnabledPalettes`): known ids only, preset order, default forced in; a missing field
  (legacy settings) = all on. Pinned by `settings-sanitize.test.ts`.
- Tabs lay cards out on `GRID` in `screens/settings-shell.ts` (`grid items-start gap-5 xl:grid-cols-2`: explicit columns, NOT CSS `columns`).
- **Save prints a receipt, and nothing is re-rendered** (`island/lib/settings-save.ts`) — `PUT /api/settings`, then
  "Saved at 14:02" beside a Save key back to disabled. The admin chrome and the public header pick the change up on
  the next page the server draws.
