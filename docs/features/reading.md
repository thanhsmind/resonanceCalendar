# Reading and discovery

## Reading & discovery

- The feature switches are `FeatureSettings` in `src/types.ts` (Admin → Settings → Posts),
  gated in header / `/search` / post page.
  `bookText` = book-page typesetting on the post body (first-line indent + justify ≥600px);
  **ON for a new blog since 2026-09-12**, and a blog that already has a settings row keeps
  the look it had (the asymmetry is in `fromStored`). It governs the SCROLLING article only:
  book mode sets its own text either way (`web/book-text.css.ts`). `gridView` =
  the reader's grid/list header toggle (`GridToggle`); off hides the button AND `listing.ts` ignores a
  stored `list=grid`, so every listing stays a list (and the infinite-scroll timeline, hidden in grid, always shows).
  Under 640px the button is not offered at all (`mobile.css.ts`): measured at 390, a grid there
  was the same one column minus its excerpts. A choice made on a laptop still travels.
- **Sidebar** (`sidebar`): the MAIN (listing) sidebar has two layouts, chosen by `settings.sidebarLayout`
  (**Settings → Home & menu**): `single` (default) = one left rail with every block stacked
  (full-width column); `two` = **TWO gutter rails on desktop** flanking a narrower reading column
  (listing column = 80% of the post width, via `--shell-w`; the extra compactness pulls both rails in) —
  the two-rail geometry/CSS is emitted ONLY in this mode. **Left rail** = discovery: **most viewed** (auto: top
  `settings.mostViewedCount` public posts by all-time views — default 3, `0` hides it —
  `getViewTotals()` joined to `getPublicPosts()`) + **featured** (owner-curated `settings.featured`
  slugs, in order, first 5, dropped when a slug stops being public). **Right rail** = navigation:
  **menu** (`SidebarMenu`, moved out of the header) + **categories** (a condensed wrapped cloud with
  post counts in parentheses — `CategoryCloud`, `getPublicTaxonomy()`) + **tags** (`TagCloud`). On
  **mobile** there is ONE gutter-less drawer: the left rail is hidden and its two blocks
  are duplicated into the right rail's drawer (`.drawer-only`), giving the order menu → most viewed →
  featured → categories → tags. Assembled in `ListingSidebar` (two `<Rail className="rail-left|rail-right">`
  reusing `IndexBlock`/`CategoryCloud`/`TagCloud`); the geometry (per-page breakpoint + column width + right-rail mirror)
  is injected from `src/render/rail-css.ts` (`singleRailCss` for the layout's default/post ToC rail,
  `listingRailCss` for the two rails — the latter uses higher-specificity `.rail.rail-left|right` so it
  wins without ordering games). Each block self-hides when empty. **Post/page reading views show ONLY the
  menu and the `toc`** in a single left rail (full width; the free right gutter stays for wide images). **Between
  60rem and the rail breakpoint the rail is a BAND** under the title (`singleRailCss`): the menu and
  the index as wrapped rows on a hairline, the index folding on its heading (`details`/`summary` in
  `article.ts`, inert everywhere else). Measured at 1024 with the default 672px column the breakpoint
  is 1272, so an iPad on its side had no index and a drawer over the article. Below 60rem the drawer
  opens from the **header menu button** (`rail()` in `assets/js/theme.ts`, mobile only; self-hides
  on pages with no rail) — no separate header dropdown. **The menu is on the header row ONLY where no
  rail can hold it** — the composed front page (`siteMenu` in `web/chrome.ts` behind
  `ChromeOptions.menuInHeader`, `.site-menu` from 60rem up) — and on every page of the newspaper
  look, whose masthead is where a paper lists its sections (the rail's copy is hidden there). It
  briefly rendered on every page, which doubled the links on every listing; reverted 2026-08-03.
  An article's rail leads with the menu above its contents (`menuBlock` in `article.ts`). Below
  60rem only the drawer has it, except in the newspaper look's sideways-scrolling strip. Menu + most-viewed count + featured are edited in
  **Admin → Settings → Home & menu**; `getViewTotals` (`src/analytics/summary.ts`) reads
  `analytics.db` directly and returns `{}` on any error, so a broken analytics database costs the
  block, not the page.
- **Infinite scroll** (`infiniteScroll`, off by default): on every listing (home / category / tag) the
  feed grows as the reader scrolls instead of paginating, and a **date timeline** fills the right gutter.
  A page carries **three chunks of `postsPerPage`** and then a real link to the next page; the island
  reads that link's address, hides it, fetches the next page as the reader nears the end, and merges the
  year groups so a year is never printed twice. Nothing on the page is hidden — what is not there was not
  sent — so a reader with no JavaScript sees the link and walks the archive a page at a time, and a
  failed fetch puts the link back. `/page/[n]` therefore EXISTS in this mode and carries
  `noindex, follow`: it is the reader's and the island's way through, not a URL to index. ⚠ Until
  2026-09-07 the server rendered every card and hid the tail, which was 49,905 bytes on a 33-post demo
  and would have been about 450 KB on a five-hundred-post blog, per visit and per cache entry; the
  reveals also moved the footer under a reader who had reached it (0.136 CLS at 390px, now 0). The left
  rail is forced to its single-rail
  branch (all blocks stacked); the right gutter holds a **date timeline** — but NOT a boxed widget: a spine
  runs the full height of the feed (`.post-list::after`) and the FIRST card of each month/year carries a
  timeline. The feed is grouped by year (`.tl-yr`): each **month**'s first card carries a `.tl-mark` (round
  `--c-meta` dot + month name) absolutely positioned in the gutter and scrolling with the post, while the
  **year** is a STICKY header (`.tl-year` = a 0-size gutter anchor; `.tl-year-tag` = a compact `fs-h3` number
  + accent dot on a `--c-bg` background) that pins to the top of the gutter while its year's posts scroll and
  is pushed out when the next year's group arrives — the tag's background masks months sliding up under it.
  A year's own first month is skipped (the sticky year covers it). Dates line up with the posts on the left —
  **no JS, no measurement** (`PostCard`'s `month` prop + CSS `position:sticky`; geometry from `timelineCss`).
  The spine is the same faint `--c-rule` hairline as the sidebar dividers; dots are round. No post counts, no click nav. Its breakpoint is much LOWER
  than the sidebar's (a short date label needs only a thin gutter — `colWidth + 2*(gap+130)`), so it shows on
  normal laptops. **Desktop list view only**: below the breakpoint there is no gutter (markers + spine
  `display:none`), and the **grid view** hides them AND dissolves the year groups (`.tl-yr{display:contents}`)
  back to a plain card grid. The `reveal` card easing is pure CSS so appended cards animate for free.
- **Lead post** (`leadPost`): the newest post on home page 1 takes the `h1` role, the rest stay `h2`.
  Sizes come from the type roles, so the display size is an Admin → Appearance setting, not CSS.
- **Category label** (`categoryLabel`) and **standfirst** (`deck`, the excerpt under a post title).
- `/search` — **two layers:** a lean local index (`GET /api/search/index`, `{slug,title,date,terms}`,
  instant + accent-insensitive) merged with `GET /api/search?q=` (SQLite FTS5 over title + BODY via
  `searchPosts`, `posts_fts match ?` joined back to live published rows). FTS5 folds diacritics in
  the index (`remove_diacritics 2`, `schema.sql`), so a query typed without accents finds accented
  text; a query typed WITH them is narrowed back to them by `src/accent.ts`, because a folded index
  answers "lề" with every "lệ" and "lê" as well. The header search is a
  `<dialog>` overlay opened by `src/assets/js/search.ts`, on the one `.overlay` panel the
  sign-up overlay shares (`subscribe.css.ts`); the `/search` route stays for deep links
  and no-JS.
- Post page: back-to-top, ToC and related posts (`getRelatedPosts`: shared tags ×2 + categories).
  The reading-progress bar is CSS (`animation-timeline: scroll()`), not an island. There is no
  loading skeleton: a page is rendered on the server and sent in one piece, so there is nothing to
  stream into.
- `Toc` shows whenever a post has headings OR an in-page jump (`showToc` in the page; renders
  nothing otherwise). When the post MIXES levels (H2 + H3), top-level rows get `.rail-lead` (a bigger
  `•` dot marker via `::before`) and child rows get `.rail-sub` (smaller, no dot) — so it reads as a
  few big markers over quieter children; the dot is inline so it flows for both rail orientations. An
  all-H2 or all-H3 ToC stays uniform. In the gutter rail the ToC is sticky (`.rail-inner`); `railCss`
  caps it to the viewport with `overflow-y:auto`, so a ToC longer than the screen scrolls inside its own
  box instead of pinning its tail off-screen (the drawer already scrolls via `.rail`). Header: clickable **"Tiêu đề"** (`tocTitle`) that scrolls to top when there
  ARE headings, else a plain non-clickable **"Mục lục"** (`tocIndex`). One line under it joins the
  present tags/categories/comments labels (comments prefixed with their server-rendered count) and
  jumps to the first existing section via `TOC_ANCHORS` + `scroll-mt-24` targets. Collapsible on
  every viewport — pinned in the desktop gutter, and on mobile it shares the sidebar drawer (opened
  from the header menu button, mobile only), outside-tap/Escape-dismissable. Solid page background;
  `post-content.ts` assigns slug ids. Phones get wider side gutters for the reading text.
- **Heading ids are de-duped** (2nd `foo` → `foo-2`): `dedupeHeadingIds`
  (`src/render/post-content.ts`) and `extractHeadings` (`src/utils.ts`) run the SAME counter over
  H2/H3 in document order — change one, change both or the ToC anchors break.
- **Link hrefs are sanitized** (`safeHref` in `post-content.ts` drops `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:`)
  — marked v5+ no longer does. Raw HTML in markdown is already escaped (the `html` renderer →
  `escapeHtml`), so `<script>`/`<img onerror>` render as visible text.
- **Draft preview:** `/preview/:slug?key=<hmac>` (`src/web/preview.ts`), sent
  `cache-control: no-store` and `x-robots-tag: noindex, nofollow`, and never entered in the page
  cache. `previewToken` = HMAC(slug, `serverSecret('preview-link')`) — **not** `AUTH_SECRET`,
  which left with next-auth and, while the code still read it, silently keyed every token with
  the empty string. The editor's "Preview draft" button saves pending edits first, then opens the
  URL in a new tab. The separate route is what keeps `/:slug` published-only, with no branch in it
  that a token could reach.

## Footnotes + music embeds — `src/render/footnotes.ts`, `src/render/video.ts`, `src/render/post-content.ts`

- **Footnotes:** `text[^id]` + `[^id]: definition`. `prepareFootnotes` (pre-marked) pulls the
  definitions out and swaps each reference for a private-use placeholder (so marked leaves it
  alone and the html-escaping renderer can't touch it); `applyFootnotes` (post-marked) turns
  placeholders into `<sup class="fnref">` links and appends `<section class="footnotes"><ol>`
  with back-links. Numbered by first reference; a `[^x]` in a fenced code block is masked and
  ignored; a ref with no def stays literal; an unreferenced def is dropped. Definition text →
  `renderInlineMarkdown` (escaped). CSS: `.fnref` / `.footnotes` / `.fn-back` in `src/web/public.css.ts`.
- **Spotify / Apple Music:** `videoEmbed` recognizes `open.spotify.com/{track,album,playlist,
  episode,show}/…` and `music.apple.com/<cc>/{album,playlist,song,music-video}/…` and returns
  the official `/embed` URL. `buildVideos` renders these as an `audio-embed` (fixed 175px frame)
  instead of a 16:9 `video-embed`. Plain `<iframe>` like the video embeds — NO third-party
  script, so no CSP change (the CSP sets no `frame-src`/`default-src`, so iframes are allowed).
  The Apple Music URL is quote-guarded against an `src` breakout.
## Highlighter + callouts + copy-code — `src/pen/` (grammar, dies, pigments, sheets — one self-contained module, door at `src/pen/index.ts`), `src/render/post-content.ts` (`buildCallouts`), `src/assets/js/code-copy.ts`

- **Highlighter:** `==text==` → `<mark data-pen=…>`; `==text==#green` adds `data-ink=…` (5 inks).
  Inline marked extension, so bold/links/code ride under one stroke; `==` may not open/close on
  space, so `x == y` is untouched. The look is CSS, never markup (`src/pen/ink.css.ts`): 12 grown
  dies × 80 grips (`src/pen/dies-highlight.ts`), each die carrying its physics — fibre grain,
  edge tremor, wet-to-dry — applied inside the data-URI (ADR 0042); dealt per highlight by the
  `data-pen` hash of its own
  text — identity in the markup, appearance in the sheet. ADR 0018, amended by 0025.
- **Underline & ring:** `++text++` → `<u data-pen>` (graphite pencil; `#green` picks a
  ballpoint-strength ink) and `@@word@@` → `<mark data-form="o" data-pen>` (red ballpoint). Same
  grammar guards, same hash-dealt dies; the ring is two fixed-width caps plus a stretching middle
  so its end curves never flatten on a long word. Owner toggles `features.penUnderline` /
  `features.penRing` flip the CSS only — cached bodies never re-render. ADR 0026.
- **The reader's pen:** `src/assets/js/reader-pen.ts` (own bundle, `features.readerPen`), anchored by
  text-quote selector in `pen-anchor.ts`, stored per path in `localStorage` (`pen-store.ts`).
  Draws with the writer's elements and sheets, linking the sheets on demand; the quote gesture
  moves into its bar, and a mark can be sent to the reader's own notebook (ADR 0045). ADR 0043.
  Tier two (`pen-sync.ts`, `src/web/pen-routes.ts`, ADR 0047): a reader may keep the same marks
  on the server under a notebook code or their commenter sign-in — `reader_marks` holds the
  page's list under an opaque id, the server's copy wins on load, every change is written back,
  and a year untouched sweeps it. The owner sees none of it; `features.readerPen` off is a 404.
  ON by default, and **asked once during setup** (step three, `setup-page.ts`): it is the only
  switch here that changes what other people may do on your pages, and an owner who never opens
  Settings never learns it is there.
- **The pen elsewhere:** `GET /pen.css` is both halves under the `.pen` class in this blog's inks,
  for a page that is not a Quire Ink — `docs/pen.md`, ADR 0048.
- **Lists by the pen:** `src/pen/lists.css.ts` — bullets are ink dots and level dashes (masks painted
  in `currentColor`, so one shape serves every palette), numbered lists count in a Kalam digit
  subset (`/fonts/kalam-digits.woff2`, fetched only when a glyph needs it). A task item
  (`li.task`, stamped by the renderer) and an `ol[start]` keep the browser's marker. Owner
  toggle `features.penLists`, CSS only. ADR 0042.
- **Mathematics:** `$$…$$` / `\[…\]` display, `$…$` / `\(…\)` inline. Temml renders LaTeX to
  **MathML at render time**, so a reader downloads no script, no sheet and no font for it. The TeX
  is never parsed as Markdown (`a_1` would become emphasis). `$…$` carries Pandoc's three guards
  so `$5 và $10` and `$5-$8` stay money — the failing sentences are tests. A formula Temml cannot
  parse falls back to the escaped source with no colour of its own. `src/web/math.css.ts` adds one
  rule that matters: the block scrolls so the page never does. ADR 0020.
- **Callouts:** write a blockquote whose first line is `[!NOTE]` / `[!TIP]` / `[!WARNING]` /
  `[!IMPORTANT]` / `[!CAUTION]`. `buildCallouts` (a post-process on marked's HTML) rewrites it to
  `<div class="callout callout-<type>">` with a bold label; an unknown `[!FOO]` or a plain quote
  is untouched. Styling is monochrome (accent left-border + label) to stay on the palette — no
  semantic colours. CSS in `src/web/public.css.ts` (`.callout`, `.callout-label`).
- **Copy-code:** `codeCopy()` in `post.js` attaches a "Copy" button to every `.prose pre`. Shiki
  highlights server-side at save time, so the button is the one part that has to be added in the
  browser.
- **Deferred:** X / Instagram / gist embeds (need third-party widget scripts + CSP allowances).

## Series / collections — `src/content/series.ts`, `/series/:slug`

- **A series is a name + order on the post**, not a table: the `series` (text) and
  `series_order` (int) columns on `posts`. A post belongs to at most one series. Assign it in
  the editor (Settings panel: a Series field with a datalist of existing names + an Order
  number shown once a series is set). `getAllSeriesNames` feeds the autocomplete (incl. drafts).
- **Ordering** (`orderSeries`, pure — in `src/content/series-order.ts`, kept db-free so both the
  server and the admin can import it): `series_order` ascending, then date
  ascending — so a series reads oldest-to-newest / lowest-order-first. `getSeriesForPost(slug)`
  returns the ordered PUBLIC siblings + the current index (a draft/scheduled part never shows).
- **Series box** (`src/web/article.ts`) renders at the top of a post when its series has >1 public
  part: a `Part n/total` line linking to `/series/:slug` and the ordered list of parts (current
  part highlighted, not linked). Colours are theme tokens only (`border-rule`, `text-meta`,
  `text-heading`, `link-accent`).
- **Admin management** (Content → **Series** drawer,
  [`screens/content-drawers.ts`](../../src/web/admin/screens/content-drawers.ts) drawing and
  [`island/lib/write-drawers.ts`](../../src/admin/island/lib/write-drawers.ts) acting): every
  series (incl. drafts) built from the write column's own post index via `seriesEntries` (pure) —
  no extra fetch. Per series: **rename** (across all its posts, merges on collision) / **remove**
  (clears `series`+`series_order`, posts untouched) / **reorder** parts with up-down arrows. Each
  action POSTs `/api/series` (`updateSeries` / `reorderSeries`, owner-gated) then reloads.
  `series_order` is otherwise set per-post in the editor's Settings panel.
- **`/series/:slug`** lists a series in the owner's order and is never paginated: a series is read
  front to back and is not a timeline. Slug derived with `slugify` **falling back to the name
  itself**, and reverse-resolved by `resolveSeries` from either spelling — like categories and
  tags, which is what that sentence promised before either of them did it. `slugify` folds Latin
  and Cyrillic and drops the rest, so before 2026-09-19 a series named in Japanese, Korean, Thai,
  Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Greek or Chinese had slug `""` and NO address: `/series/` answered 404
  and so did `/series/<the name>`, because the resolver compared slugs only. Held in the page cache like every other public page, so
  an admin save empties it along with everything else (Invariant 1).

## The year archive — `src/content/archive.ts`, `src/web/archive-page.ts`, `features.archive`

- **`/archive` is every published post on one page**, newest year first, as rows of `MM-DD` +
  title — no excerpt, no thumbnail. It answers "what has this person written", which nothing
  else did: an old post was reachable only through a tag, through search, or by paging back
  through the listing (on a 100-post blog, page eleven).
- **One page, not `/archive/2024`.** Years are anchors (`#y2024`), so the jump row at the top
  costs no request; the row is dropped below two years. Cached like every listing.
- **`byYear` reads the year off the ISO string**, not `new Date(...).getFullYear()`: the stored
  value is UTC, and a post published 1 January at 02:00 UTC files itself under the previous
  year on any host west of Greenwich. It lives in `content/` because the sidebar reads it too,
  and importing it the other way would close a cycle through `web/listing-page.ts`.
- **The date column is numeric on purpose.** A month name needs each language's own day/month
  order ("19 tháng 6" vs "June 19") — a twelfth locale string and a per-language branch for a
  column `5ch` wide. The full date is on the `<time datetime>` for anything reading rather
  than looking. Below 34rem the date moves above its title instead of holding a fifth of the line.
- **A page or post the owner already publishes at `/archive` wins**, and the year index gives
  way silently (`renderArticle('archive') ?? renderArchive()`). This repository's own demo had
  such a page, and every imported WordPress site could; a release that takes over a live URL is
  the failure an upgrade is least forgiven for. The sitemap then names the URL once, as the
  document it really is.
- **The way in is the rail**: a `termCloud` of years with counts, above the tags because a tag
  cloud is the one rail block with no ceiling on its length. Off with the same switch.

## The printed page — `src/web/print.css.ts` (inlined into `public.css.ts`)

- **What survives:** the masthead as one line of provenance, the article, its footnotes, its
  tags. Nothing else — no controls, no related posts, no comment thread, no subscribe card.
  The owner's type settings come with it at the size they chose, and the pen marks keep their
  colour, because they are the reason a page off this site looks like this site.
- **Why the sheet is shaped the way it is** — the three rules any change to it answers to —
  is [conventions/layout.md](../conventions/layout.md#paper-is-a-surface-printcssts).
- **No separate stylesheet and no `media="print"` link.** `PRINT_CSS` is appended inside
  `public.css.ts`, so it ships in the one sheet the page already downloads and costs a reader
  no extra request. Held by `src/web/print.test.ts`.

## Copy a quote — `src/assets/js/quote.ts`

- **What:** select text inside a post and one control appears — **Copy quote**. It puts the
  sentence on the clipboard with a link that opens the post *at that sentence*, scrolled to
  it and highlighted by the reader's own browser.
- **Not a share button.** Nothing is sent anywhere, no account is involved and no third party
  is contacted: the link is an ordinary URL with a `#:~:text=` fragment, so a browser that
  does not know the trick simply opens the post.
- **On a phone it sits BELOW the selection**, which is where the operating system's own Copy
  menu is not.
- **The link stays readable.** The obvious way to build one percent-encodes every non-Latin
  letter, which turned a Vietnamese sentence into two hundred characters of hex — a URL
  fragment carries UTF-8 as it is. Escaped instead: whitespace, the three characters this
  syntax reserves (`-` `,` `#`), `%` first so the escapes cannot escape each other, and
  `&` `"` `<` `>` `` ` `` so a URL that lands in HTML somewhere cannot open a tag. A long
  quote is anchored on its two ends rather than carried whole, each end trimmed back to a
  whole word.

## The way onward, and the way back — `src/web/article.ts` (`features.readNext`), `src/assets/js/resume.ts` (`features.resume`)

Both owner-approved 2026-08-27, both default **on**, both toggled from the Reading card.

- **Read next** ends every post with ONE pointer forward: the next part of its series when
  there is one (labelled `readNextSeries`), else the ADJACENT post — the **older** neighbour
  first, because the index is newest-first and a reader who just finished this post is walking
  back through the archive; only the oldest post points toward newer. It sits after the
  taxonomy rule and before Related: a whispered label (`.read-next-label`, small role) and the
  title as the only thing at reading size (`--fs-h3`). Server markup — costs the bundle
  nothing. Route tests in `src/web/read-next.test.ts`.
- **Resume** keeps the reader's place in THEIR browser and nowhere else
  (`localStorage`, `quire:resume:<pathname>`, 90 days): past 1.5 viewports a position is worth
  keeping, past 92% the post counts as finished and is **forgotten** — "continue where you left
  off" at the end of a text is not memory, it is nagging. Returning near the top raises one
  pill, bottom centre, that scrolls back on click (instant under `prefers-reduced-motion`) and
  withdraws once the reader scrolls >200px on their own: scrolling IS the answer. The localized
  prompt rides `<body data-resume-prompt>` only when the feature is on — no words, no island.
  It cannot collide with the to-top button: the pill requires `scrollY < innerHeight`, the
  button the opposite. Cost ~1.1 KB in `post.js` (priced in `scripts/build-assets.ts`).

## Reading with no signal — `src/assets/js/sw.ts`, `src/assets/js/offline.ts`, `features.offline`

- **What:** a post the reader already opened still opens with no network. **Off by default**
  ([ADR 0039](../decisions/0039-the-blog-reads-without-the-network.md)) — a service worker
  outlives the page that installed it, and putting one on every existing blog's readers
  because the software updated is the owner's decision being assumed rather than respected.
- **Nothing is prefetched.** A page is in the cache because it was READ. This does not reopen
  the prefetch judgement in [performance.md](../performance.md); nothing here speculates.
- **HTML network-first, `/assets/<hash>.*` and `/fonts/*` cache-first.** Online the reader
  always gets what the server just rendered; the immutable URLs cannot serve a stale answer
  because a deploy changes them. Forty pages, kept by COUNT — `Cache.put` reports no size
  without reading the body.
- **The uninstall is the load-bearing half.** `data-sw` is absent from `<body>` when the
  feature is off, and `offline.ts` reads that absence as "unregister and drop every `quire-*`
  cache". It runs from `core.js`, on every public page, because the switch can only take
  effect on a page the reader happens to load and most of those are listings. Cost 676 bytes
  raw / 235 gzipped (budget 10,500 → 11,000, priced in `scripts/build-assets.ts`).
- **Where it is proved:** `src/web/offline.test.ts` holds the server's half (the root path,
  the `no-cache` header, `data-sw` only when on, an `install` handler that does nothing but
  take over). The rest is only true in a browser and is a tour flow — a page read and found
  in the cache, `/admin` read and found NOT in it, then the whole thing taken back off.
- The recommended CSP in [self-host.md](../self-host.md) already allows `worker-src 'self'`.

## Book reading mode — `src/assets/js/book.ts`, `features.bookMode`

- **What:** an opt-in "Chế độ đọc sách" link on the post meta line (after the reading time)
  opens the article as a **fullscreen two-column book spread**, paged horizontally and with a
  soft fade between spreads. Gated by `features.bookMode` (default **on**; the "Reading
  features" card in Admin → Settings → **Posts**). **Posts only** (the toggle is emitted
  from the post branch of `src/web/article.ts`).
- **The reader sets the type size.** The a/A pair in the overlay chrome moves `--type-scale` between
  0.85 and 1.35 in 0.05 steps, persisted per browser under `quire-book-scale` and written as an
  INLINE override, so a reader who has never touched it follows whatever the sheet ships. The
  sheet's own default is **1.05** (it was 1.15 until 2026-08-21). Every change re-measures: a
  bigger glyph is fewer lines per column, which is a different page count.
- **Not the Fullscreen API — a `<dialog>`.** Escape, focus trapping and the inert background come
  from the browser instead of from this file, so **desktop and iPad behave identically** and there
  are no Safari fullscreen quirks. Scroll is locked with `body:has(.book-overlay[open])`.
  **A phone gets in through a floating button**, not through the meta line: both server-rendered
  entries hide under 767px. `.book-fab` is a twin of the to-top circle one slot up the same
  column, on the same scroll trigger, and the stylesheet keeps it off desktop. **Under 640px it
  opens the SCROLLED reader** (`book-scroll.ts`, `book-phone.css.ts`): the article laid out as
  one column in the document, so iOS's own bars retract while the page moves; the chrome
  follows the direction (away on the way down, back on the way up), the paper covers the
  safe area, and the phone's back gesture leaves the reader rather than the article. Between
  640 and 767px it opens the dialog in one-page mode.
  **Always paper**
  — the `::backdrop` and the overlay's own tokens are a warm-paper palette regardless of the site
  theme or dark mode; closing restores the page's own tokens.
- **Opened from `[data-book-open]`,** and ALL matches are bound: an article carries two toggles
  (the meta line above the title and the info panel in the right gutter) and exactly one has a box
  at any given width, so binding only the first left the button dead on whichever layout lost.
  A **drop cap** opens the first paragraph (`.book-flow.prose > p:first-child::first-letter`).
- **How it paginates:** the reader **clones** the already-rendered `.prose` markup (Shiki
  highlight, images, footnotes intact — no re-render), flows it into a CSS `column-width` element
  sized so the spread is exactly as wide as the site's content column at a fixed page height, and
  reads `scrollWidth` to count columns → spreads = `ceil(cols / pages)`. The flow is itself `.prose`,
  so the reading view's indents and justification apply unchanged. **Wide images
  (`figure.img-wide`) render at column width here**, so a wide image never spills into the next
  column. Advancing is one **transform on the flow**, slid by `glide()` at `--dur-base` on the
  sheet's own curve and an instant jump behind the motion gate — the browser has
  already done the pagination, and re-implementing it is how this becomes a measurement loop that
  fights the layout engine. **It slides; it does not blink.** Until 2026-09-14 the turn
  cross-faded the whole spread — out over 150ms, jump, back over 150ms, measured on the
  published page — and pages arriving out of nothing read as a blink however carefully it is
  timed. The window already clips and the spine is drawn on the WINDOW rather than on the
  flow, so moving the flow under it is the motion the object was always describing: the pages
  travel and the gutter holds still. Recomputes on resize. The base page keeps normal scroll, so **SEO,
  a11y and find-in-page are untouched**.
- **It was `scrollLeft` until Chrome 148, and that is worth knowing before you "simplify" it
  back.** The engine stopped treating a multicol's overflow columns as scrollable overflow —
  measured on the fixture, `flow.scrollWidth` 3,964px against `viewport.scrollWidth` 279px, and
  an assigned `scrollLeft` snapping straight back to 0 — so every instance showed "1 / 1" of
  every article with dead arrows and no error anywhere. It also stopped **painting** those
  columns, so a translated flow came up blank paper past page one. Hence two things in
  `book.ts`: the turn is a transform, and the flow is explicitly width-sized to hold every
  column as a real box. The count reads `flow.scrollWidth`, never the viewport's. Two tour
  flows pin it, desktop and 375px, because 57 green flows said nothing while this was broken.
- **Media** stays column-width (no full-bleed) and is capped to one page height (`--book-page-h`)
  with `break-inside: avoid`, so images/code/tables never overflow a spread. `--font-reading`
  drives the body; all colours are theme tokens. Motion asks `motionOn()`: the owner's switch AND the media query.
- **A spread is TWO pages only while two pages can hold words.** Below `MIN_COLUMN * 2 + COL_GAP`
  the reader drops to **one** page, `viewport[data-pages="1"]` hides the centre spine, and the
  page count divides by one instead of two. The spread used to be an unconditional two, which at
  390px meant two 119px columns of about ten characters each. A phone reaches that state **on
  purpose** now, and a narrow window that still shows the rail reaches it too: the rail is
  subtracted from the footprint, so the spread can be far narrower than the window.
  Pinned by `shell.test.ts`.
- **A phone is not a narrow desktop.** Under 640px the reader is the scrolled column above, with
  a fixed chrome (the title, the a/A pair shared through `sizeControl`, close) and an edge swipe
  back. Between 640 and 767px the one-page dialog keeps 20px margins, the hover arrows retire,
  and the turn is a **swipe** (48px, 1.5× more sideways than down) or a **tap in the outer
  thirds**; under 520px the running head goes silent rather than stammering into the size buttons.
- **The running head reserves room for the page count**, which lives in an absolutely positioned
  box and therefore takes part in no layout. Without the reservation the centred title ran under
  it and printed as `owning your ow1 / 5`. **The reservation is twice the box**, because the
  head is centred and half of whatever it is allowed grows rightwards: reserving the box once
  let a long title run under the size pair again the day it was widened. 540px since 2026-08-27.
- **The chrome is three things, and is spaced to say so** (2026-08-27, reported as hard to
  read and ugly). The size pair is a small `a` and a large `A`, **plain glyphs on the
  paper, on one shared baseline** — the size difference is the whole label. The pill-and-rule
  cut that preceded it read as buttons (the owner's second complaint), and wore a "black seam"
  on first paint: `showModal()` focuses the first focusable element, and the pill's
  `overflow:hidden` cropped that focus ring to a single dark line between the two halves.
  Initial focus now lands on the stage via `autofocus` (tabindex −1, no outline), so keyboard
  focus rings survive on every control without one being worn at open. The page count sits
  18px away, and the close button 26px further, as a round target that fills under the pointer.
