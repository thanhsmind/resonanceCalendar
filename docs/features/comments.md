# Comments

## Comments — `src/comments/`, `src/web/comments.ts`, `src/assets/js/comments.ts`

Text-only reader comments, **off by default** (`settings.comments.enabled`). Identity is either
manual (name + email + optional website, behind the blog's own stamp gate — or Turnstile when keyed, ADR 0032) or a signed-in
Google account.

- **The form is a card, on the same terms as the newsletter block above it** (border, radius and
  padding all match `.subscribe-card`). Until 2026-07-31 it was the one thing on a post with no
  boundary at all: a Google button, three fields, a textarea, a Turnstile widget and a submit,
  each floating separately on the page background, which is what made the section read as pasted
  in from somewhere else. Name and email now share a two-column grid (they were each spanning the
  full reading width, so a three-field form looked like a column of wide empty boxes), the
  textarea has a VISIBLE label rather than only an `aria-label`, and the Turnstile widget shares
  one row with the submit. Everything collapses to a single column below 640px. A reply form
  opens inside the thread and drops the border, because a card inside a card boxes a box.

- **A comment body is set at the ARTICLE's size**, not the thread's. It already used the
  reading face; running it at `--fs-small` like the rest of `#comments` meant the same
  typeface as the piece two steps smaller, which reads as a caption rather than as somebody
  talking. Only the words grow: the meta line, the reply link and the whole form stay small.
  The meta line itself is `// name · [date at time]` — the marker is the one every block on
  the page opens with (the source-code look only), and the time is there because two replies on the
  same day said nothing about their order without it.

- **Instant, never cached — by design.** The page itself is cached; the comment block is an
  island (`assets/js/comments.ts`, shipped as its own bundle `comment-thread.js` and named on
  a page only when the block is rendered) that fetches `/api/comments?post=<slug>`, and that route is
  refused a shared cache like everything under `/api`, so its read is always live. A new comment
  is POSTed and the thread is then RE-READ, which is what makes it appear. There is no optimistic
  overlay: 2.0 dropped the one the frozen tree had, along with `mergeOptimisticComments`, because
  a refetch is drift-free by construction where an overlay has to keep a second renderer in step
  with the server's. A failed POST leaves the form filled and prints the server's own message.
  Nothing invalidates the page cache for a comment.
- **Limited markdown (`comment-md.ts`):** only `**bold**` / `*italic*`. The source is HTML-escaped
  FIRST, then only `<strong>/<em>/<br>` are injected — no user tag, link, image, or script survives
  (mirrors Invariant 5). Hard cap 1000 chars (server + client).
- **3-tier threading.** `depth` (0/1/2) is enforced server-side in `addComment` (a reply needs
  `parent.depth < 2`); display nesting is rebuilt from the actual ancestry. `buildCommentTree`
  (pure, tested) re-roots orphans (parent purged) and renders a deleted-but-still-replied node as a
  blanked **tombstone**; a deleted leaf is pruned.
- **Sign-in, in 2.0** (`src/web/comment-auth.ts`, `src/comments/{commenter,google-oauth}.ts`,
  [ADR 0013](../decisions/0013-google-sign-in-for-commenters.md)): `next-auth` is gone, so a
  commenter is a signed `__Host-` cookie rather than a session row — 30 days, HMAC over name +
  address + expiry, no table. The client id and secret are entered in **Settings → Comments & mail**.
  A signed-in comment takes its identity from the cookie and IGNORES the request body, records
  `provider = 'google'` and skips Turnstile. Turning the toggle off stops trusting cookies
  already issued, rather than waiting for them to lapse.
- **Privacy:** email is stored but NEVER sent to the public client (separate `PUBLIC_COLS` vs
  `ADMIN_COLS`); website gets `rel="nofollow ugc noopener"`. `/api/comments/me` returns the
  signed-in NAME only, and is the one public response on the site marked `no-store`.
- **Post rename / purge:** `renameComments` moves comments with the slug; `deleteCommentsForPost`
  clears them when a post is purged (both wired in `posts.ts`).
- **Admin:** `/admin/comments` is a reading queue on one sheet (2026-08-18): each comment is two
  lines of its text (click toggles the full text per row; replies are flat rows, so each toggles on
  its own) over one small-print ledger — name, email, post, time, IP with the ISO country in parens
  (`1.2.3.4 (VN)`, best-effort from the proxy/Cloudflare edge header, blank when absent, `—` on
  pre-feature rows) — and a quiet Delete at its end. Rows fill two newspaper columns from `lg` up.
  The sheet-top search reaches the text, the name and the post title (accent-folded one way only —
  `src/accent.ts`: typed WITH accents it means them) and paints
  hits with the pen (`Marked`). Delete = soft delete via owner-gated `DELETE /api/comments/[id]`
  → Trash (restore/purge on the Trash screen's Comments tab).
- **The gate — `src/comments/stamp.ts`, `src/assets/js/stamp.ts` ([ADR 0032](../decisions/0032-the-comment-gate-needs-no-account.md)).**
  Manual comments carry a **stamp**: a challenge the server signs into the comments mount point,
  solved in the reader's browser with `crypto.subtle` while they type, and spent on send. No
  account, no third-party request, no state — the HMAC is the storage, and only a Map of spent
  salts is kept. Verdicts are separate on purpose: `expired` answers **409** so the island
  re-solves a fresh challenge and sends again (a page can sit in a cache longer than a stamp
  lives), everything else answers 400. The issue time doubles as a floor — under three seconds
  was not typed. **Turnstile takes over whenever its keys are set** (since 2026-08-27);
  Settings → Comments & mail says which gate is standing. A signed-in Google reader skips both.
  Without a secure context there is no `crypto.subtle`, so only the age check stands: that
  install needs TLS.
- **Abuse:** manual comments only accept a published, visible post + a per-IP in-memory rate limit
  (6/min). The same IP (+ country) is persisted on the row (`author_ip`/`author_country`) for admin
  moderation — admin-only, NEVER sent to the public comment tree.
- **Integration keys live in the ADMIN, not (just) env (`src/store/integration-keys.ts`).**
  Turnstile AND Google keys are SECRETS, kept in the server-only `integration_keys` table (single
  row), set via Admin → Settings → Comments & mail (owner-gated `POST /api/comments/keys`) — NEVER in
  `settings.data`. An env var of the same name is a fallback. `getCommentEnv()`
  (`src/comments/comment-env.ts`) reports which integrations are usable (booleans) + the public
  Turnstile site key; no secret is ever sent to a client. Saving the pair calls `clearCache()`,
  because a cached page carries the old site key and the old "draw the Google button" flag.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile (`src/auth/turnstile.ts`, `src/assets/js/turnstile.ts`).** Toggle
  `settings.comments.turnstile`; **enforced only when the toggle is on AND a Turnstile secret
  exists**, so toggling on without keys never locks out commenting (the admin row shows a "needs
  keys" badge + the key inputs appear right below). The manual form gates the comment box **behind
  the Turnstile pass**; the POST verifies the token server-side via siteverify (fail closed).
  Tokens are single-use → the form re-arms after each post.
- **Google sign-in for commenters** is `settings.comments.googleAuth` and is described in the
  bullet above — the OAuth flow is `src/comments/google-oauth.ts` and the identity is a signed
  cookie, not a session row. **A signed-in commenter is never an owner**: the two are separate
  cookies, separate code paths, and the admin gate is `ownerRouter()` alone.
- **Routes:** `/api/comments` (GET list + POST create) is the ONLY public-exempt comment path, and
  it is listed with its reason in `scripts/checks/routes-guarded.ts`; `DELETE /api/comments/:id`
  stays owner-gated.
