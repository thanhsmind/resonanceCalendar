# Writing and publishing

## Editor (Admin → editor) — `src/admin/island/sheet.ts`

- Twenty-one nodes and eight marks: paragraph, heading, quote, fence, rule, hard break, the
  three lists (GFM `- [ ]` among them), captioned image, GFM tables, video, inline and display
  maths; bold, italic, strike, inline code, link, and the pen's three. `md/from-editor.ts`
  serializes all of them (ADR 0052).
- **The schema is [`editor/schema.ts`](../../src/admin/editor/schema.ts)**, written out, since
  ADR 0054's step 7 took `@tiptap/*` out. It is ONE schema for the whole admin and every editor
  built anywhere in this repository mounts the same plugin stack — including the tests, which is
  not a detail: two suites once held a hand-copied list of extensions under a comment claiming it
  was what the editor mounts, so a node added to the editor was absent from its own test.
- **Mathematics** (`MathNode.ts`): atom nodes for inline and display, rendered live with the same
  `renderMath` the server uses, TeX editable in place when the node is selected. The delimiter
  the author typed is stored on the node, which is correctness rather than polish: without it
  `\(a\)` loses its delimiters on save, and without the node at all every `\times` gains a
  second backslash. The markdown-it rule that used to register `before('escape')` is gone with
  markdown-it; the engine reads all four delimiters in one matcher (`md/math-syntax.ts`).
  ADR 0020, ADR 0052.
  - **Two toolbar buttons**, `tbMath` (display) and `tbMathInline`. Both insert an EMPTY formula
    with the caret already in its TeX box. The glyph is a pi and the lines around it carry the
    distinction: full rules above and below for its own line, a dash either side for in-sentence.
  - **Typing `\(x\)` or `$$x$$` sets it on the spot; `$…$` deliberately does not.** An input rule
    fires on the text already typed, so it cannot see the next character — and Pandoc's third
    guard ("closing `$` not followed by a digit") is a lookahead at exactly that. Typing
    `giá $5-$8`, the rule would see `$5-$` and convert the price mid-word. `$…$` stays valid
    everywhere and converts when the post is next opened, where the whole line is known.
  - ⚠️ **A RULE THAT REPLACES ONLY THE CAPTURE GROUP LEAVES THE DELIMITERS STANDING** — `\(x\)`
    saved as `\(\(x\)\)`, and with `$$…$$` the block node split the paragraph and the stray
    dollars became two paragraphs of their own. The rule in
    [`editor/input-rules.ts`](../../src/admin/editor/input-rules.ts) replaces the WHOLE match.
- **Menus live in `editor-menus.ts`** (the bubble bar and the "/" menu; the button strip is `editor-toolbar.ts`). Each
  subscribes to the editor's `transaction` event and writes its own attributes back: one handler
  updates twenty-one buttons plus the table-tools row. Before ADR 0054's step 6 the whole sheet
  re-rendered on every transaction so that `isActive()` stayed live, which means every keystroke
  rebuilt the tree to decide whether Bold looks pressed.
- **Writing shell:** the sheet carries its own chrome — the action line (back link · save state ·
  word count · Markdown/Attributes · Preview/View post/Save/Publish) is the card's first row and the toolbar
  sticks under it, full-width, groups centred, WRAPPING on a narrow window rather than scrolling
  (three owner verdicts, 2026-08-17). The title grows instead of clipping (`screens/sheet.ts`,
  reading face). The write pane — the list of everything written — rides beside the sheet from
  1640px up (measured, not chosen: `screens/content-pane.ts`).
  Icon actions keep localized accessible names. Focusing prose must not draw a black outline
  around the document.
- **Key feedback, as a choice of instrument:** `settings.motion.keys` — `woody`, `crisp`,
  `deep`, `off`, older spellings migrated on read — draws the caret this product owns and plays a
  synthesized filtered-noise click (no audio file), at `settings.motion.keyVolume` out of 100.
  Applying a highlight, underline or ring draws the stroke in over 200ms and, with
  `settings.motion.penSqueak` on, squeaks like a felt tip (ADR 0049).
  It ignores composition, modifier/navigation keys, paste, and held repeats. The master
  `settings.motion.enabled` and `prefers-reduced-motion` still gate the visual half; `off`
  makes the editor standard and silent, and a volume of 0 keeps the caret without the sound.
  Nothing animates the text itself — see [admin-editor.md](../admin-editor.md).
- **Getting a picture in:** the toolbar's **Image** (one) and **Gallery** (multi-select) buttons,
  the same two rows in the `/` menu, dragging files onto the sheet — they upload in order and
  land at the drop point, not at the stale cursor — and **pasting**. Paste was silence until
  2026-08-28: `handlePaste` read `text/plain`, found no video URL and handed back to
  ProseMirror, which has no parse rule for a file, so a pasted screenshot vanished with no
  message. It now goes through `insertImageFiles`, the same path a drop uses, so alt text,
  ordering and the caption default are identical whichever gesture you used.
- **Images and galleries** (`CaptionedImage.ts`, a plain ProseMirror node view; the fragment grammar it shares with the renderer is `image-frag.ts`): placement rides on the src fragment
  (a Markdown image whose src ends `#right-wide`) and the caption is the alt, so the node still serializes to plain
  Markdown. Size is a three-way choice: column width (unmarked), `#third` (30% of the
  column; combined with `left`/`right` the figure floats and the text runs around it —
  the one fragment that changes how prose lays out), or `#wide`. `wide` beats `third`
  when a fragment somehow carries both. A **frame** rides along with any of them, because it
  is drawn on the picture while the rest decides where the picture goes: `#frame` is the
  middle weight, `#frame-thin` and `#frame-thick` the other two, and `ink` beside any of them
  swaps the paper mat for one of ink. `thin`/`thick`/`ink` are read ONLY next to `frame`, so
  an imported URL that happens to end `#thick` frames nothing. The mat is padding on the
  `img` itself rather than a wrapper, which is why a framed picture is exactly as wide as an
  unframed one and the caption stays outside the mat; `--c-heading` makes the ink mat invert
  by itself, dark on paper and light at night, with no second token and no media query. 

  **A gallery is a run.** Two or more consecutive `#grid` images become one `.gallery`, column
  count by count (`galleryCols`). It carries two options of its own on the fragment: a **ratio**
  (`asis`, `1x1`, `3x2`, `4x3`), which crops every tile with `object-fit:cover` so rows line up,
  and **captions** (`cap` / `nocap`), which show or hide them in CSS — the alt is emitted either
  way, so it keeps serving screen readers and search. Both apply to the WHOLE run in one
  transaction (`applyToGallery`), and the new value is decided once from the tile that was
  clicked, so an inconsistent run heals instead of flip-flopping. **GOTCHA:** `groupGalleries`
  matches `img-grid[^"]*`, not `img-grid` exactly — an option appends a class, and the exact
  match made every gallery with an option silently stop grouping.
  **The editor draws the published grid, not a fixed one.** The node view asks `galleryCols`
  (`render/gallery-cols.ts`, the one home for that rule) how many columns its own run gets and
  writes the answer as `data-cols`, which `admin.css` selects on. It was a flat three across
  until 2026-08-28, so the commonest gallery of all — four pictures — read 3+1 while you wrote
  it and 2×2 once you published it, with nothing on screen saying which was true.
  **A selected tile's toolbar leaves the cell** (`.qi-tile-bar`). A tile is 202px on a desktop
  and 102px on a phone, and the bar carries up to seventeen buttons in segmented tracks that CLIP
  rather than wrap, so most of them — every crop ratio and frame weight, which is to say every
  actual choice — were cut off and unclickable. Taken out of flow it lays out against the writing
  column, above the picture whose crop is being chosen.
- **Gallery defaults, site-wide** (*Settings → Posts → Galleries*, `screens/settings-post.ts`): the shape
  and caption state every gallery follows when it has no opinion of its own. Each option is
  THREE-valued and the third value is silence: no token means "follow Settings", which is what lets
  one screen restyle a whole imported archive, and `asis` / `cap` exist so a gallery can disagree
  with a non-default site setting out loud. **The default is applied as CSS, never as markup**
  (`galleryCss` in `web/layout.ts` emits `--gallery-ratio` / `--gallery-w` / `--gallery-cap` on
  `:root`; `public.css.ts` reads them with the old behaviour as the `var()` fallback). That is not
  a style preference: a rendered body is kept under a hash of its INPUT (`body_cache`), so a
  default that changed the HTML without changing that input would leave every already-rendered
  body serving the old shape. The per-gallery override wins on specificity (tile
  class beats `:root`), not on source order.
- **Frame default, site-wide** (*Settings → Posts → Pictures*, `screens/settings-post.ts`): the mat every
  picture wears when it has no opinion of its own — `settings.figure` = a weight
  (`none` | `thin` | `medium` | `thick`) and a mat colour (paper or ink). **`none` at install**, on
  the owner's instruction: a frame is a decision about a site's voice, and arriving with one already
  made is a default nobody asked for. Same three-valued shape and the same CSS-not-markup rule as
  the gallery defaults above (`figureCss` in `web/layout.ts` emits `--fig-default-pad` /
  `--fig-default-mat` / `--fig-default-line` on `:root`, and emits NOTHING while the answer is
  `none`), and for the identical reason — a default that rewrote HTML would leave every
  already-rendered post wearing the old frame until something unrelated evicted the cache entry.
  **The default names a STEP, never a length** (`--fig-step-thin|med|thick`), and that indirection
  is load-bearing: the settings block is inlined AFTER the linked sheet, so a length would outrank
  `mobile.css.ts`'s media query and a thick default would keep its full 28px mat inside a 350px
  column. `figure-default.test.ts` pins exactly that, because the obvious implementation is the
  wrong one. Overridable in BOTH directions — a frame token on a picture overrides upward,
  `#noframe` overrides downward, which is the half that only matters once a site default exists.
- **BubbleBar:** a floating bar (`editor/bubble.ts`) over a text selection or with the
  cursor in a link — bold/italic/underline/strike/code + link edit/remove. `shouldShow` skips node
  selections (image/video) so it never covers their own controls.
- **Tables:** insert is a 3×3 with a header row; a contextual toolbar row (shown only when the
  cursor is in a table) adds/removes columns + rows or deletes the table. The header row + left
  column are shaded with `--c-rule` (the table's own border colour) as a visual spine — the
  left-column shade is CSS-only (GFM has no header-column), so it never changes the saved Markdown.
  **GOTCHA:** list items wrap content in `<p>`; they stay tight because the reset zeroes every
  margin and `PROSE_CSS` spaces only `.prose > * + *`. A spaced list carries `loose`
  (`data-loose`, `schema-nodes.ts`) so it SAVES spaced, but no rule draws it: it looks tight here.
- **Autosave is TWO copies** (`island/lib/sheet-safety.ts`; [admin-editor.md](../admin-editor.md)): unsaved
  edits go to `localStorage` on this device and to `posts.autosave_json` on the server (since
  2026-08-30), on the `autosaveSeconds` tick while dirty. Neither is the published body — only
  Save/Publish moves `content`, so editing a *published* post still cannot push half-finished
  text live. What happens on return depends on whether the piece has a row:
  - **Never saved** (the `:new` key): the snapshot is the ONLY copy there is, so it is REOPENED
    into the editor rather than offered, read synchronously so the editor mounts with it, and the
    snapshot stays in storage until a real save clears it. Until 2026-09-07 it was offered
    instead, which meant a writer who typed, left without pressing Save and came back met an
    empty page with a one-line offer above it: the text was in storage the whole time and the
    screen read as work lost.
  - **Already saved**: a snapshot that outlived its session (crash / closed tab / dropped
    connection clears nothing) surfaces a "restore / discard" bar, because here it competes with
    a saved version and replacing that without asking is the failure the bar exists to prevent.
    Restoring keeps the live slug and date; the snapshot's are not carried over.
  A successful server save clears the snapshot. **The interval alone lost work**:
  an over-scroll at the top of the editor on a phone triggers pull-to-refresh and the page
  RELOADS, and `beforeunload` does not reliably fire there — so `useLocalAutosave` also flushes on
  `pagehide`, on a `visibilitychange` to hidden, and on unmount. `beforeunload` remains the
  courtesy warning on top, not the safety net.
- Gallery insert adds all picked images in ONE `insertContent` (a per-image loop leaves only the
  last — `setImage` selects the node it inserts, so the next insert replaces it).
- Time machine: each overwrite snapshots the prior version (`revisions.ts`, keeps 3); restore
  loads it into the editor (non-destructive — current version is snapshotted on next save).

## Several pieces at once — the write column's selection bar

`island/lib/write-pick.ts` draws it, `web/admin/content-bulk.ts` answers it, and
`admin-shared/write.ts` holds the one number they share.

- **Select is a MODE**, not a control on every row: a trash icon a few pixels from the title
  you click dozens of times a day has to appear on hover to stay out of the way, which on a
  touch screen means it never appears. In the mode a row stops being a link — its `href` is
  removed, so it stops being one for the keyboard and the screen reader at the same moment it
  stops being one for the mouse.
- **Three verbs, on two rows**: Publish, Draft, Move to Trash, each printing `(N)` and each
  disabled at zero. Five controls do not fit one 320px line in any language but English. The
  count is on each key rather than in a sentence, because a count inside a sentence needs a
  plural form in half these languages — the same argument `selectPieces` settled.
- **Shift fills the range**, over what is SHOWN. Filling over hidden rows would tick pieces
  the owner never saw between the two they clicked. Select-all is one key with two words
  (`data-on` / `data-off`), and it too means what is on screen: the rows all ship and the
  island hides them, so "all" taken literally would tick two hundred rows of which the owner
  can see twelve, and then publish them.
- **One request per `BULK_MAX` pieces, not one per piece.** Every write through the owner gate
  flushes the page cache, purges the CDN and leaves a log row (Invariant 1, `web/guard.ts`), so
  fifty ticks used to be fifty of each. A selection larger than the ceiling is sent in runs of
  it — three requests for six hundred, where the old way was six hundred.
- **The route holds no `clearCache()`**, deliberately: the gate flushes on the way out of every
  2xx write, which is exactly once per request. A hand-placed call would be a second flush.
- **A status flip pushes no revision.** A post's `projection` counts status as a change, so
  `savePost` would snapshot the body before it — and only three revisions are kept per post, so
  a bulk publish would replace the owner's real earlier drafts with copies of the current body
  differing by one word. `{ revision: false }`.
- **Binning does not reload; publishing does.** The bin's whole argument for asking nothing is
  that the undo is in the toast, and a reload takes the toast with it. A status change moves a
  row's lamp, its label and which filters it answers to, and nothing in the island builds
  markup — so the page comes back, and the sentence travels with it (`lib/say-across.ts`).
- **Three log actions, not one.** `content.trash` / `content.publish` / `content.draft`, so the
  heading carries the verb; `web/admin/ops.ts` records what one kind standing for four
  importers cost. The pieces are the sentence's object, through `{t}`.

## The Markdown this blog speaks — `src/md/` (ADR 0052)

One engine, written here, with no dependencies. It renders the reader's page, opens a post in
the editor, saves it back, cuts the excerpt and writes the plain text a search index reads,
all from one parse. Four libraries used to answer those five questions separately and drifted.

- **CommonMark 0.31.2 and GFM**, measured against both specs' own examples on every run
  (`src/md/spec.test.ts`): 648 of 652 and 24 of 24. GFM adds tables, strikethrough, task
  lists and autolinks.
- **Four deliberate disagreements**, each named in that suite rather than silently failing:
  three are where GFM's autolink extension and CommonMark disagree about a bare URL or email
  (GFM links it, and so does everywhere anyone writes Markdown today), and the fourth is
  `\[ … \]`, which is display maths here rather than an escaped pair of brackets (ADR 0020).
- **This blog's own notation on top**: the pen's three gestures (`==ink==`, `++underline++`,
  `@@ring@@`, each with an optional `#colour`), maths in four delimiters, footnotes, and
  callouts.
- **What a host may change is six rules** (`md/html-rules.ts`), all defaulting to the spec:
  raw HTML passed, filtered or escaped; a soft break as a wrap or a line break; unsafe link
  schemes rewritten; a body `#` demoted; heading anchors; `scope` on a table header; and the
  function that turns TeX into markup. What this blog answers is `render/page-rules.ts`.
- **A save may not change the reader's page.** Two laws hold it: serializing twice gives the
  same text, and rendering the source and rendering what a save would write give the same
  HTML. Both run over `golden/corpus` on every test run (`src/md/round-trip.test.ts`), and
  over the shapes the corpus does NOT hold — a bracket inside a link's text, two lists in a
  row, a footnote whose definition is one word — each of which broke one of the two laws and
  is named there with what it broke.
- **A hostile document has a bounded cost** (`src/md/complexity.test.ts`). The suite measures
  rates against ordinary prose rather than a clock, because a wall-clock ceiling measures the
  machine: three quadratic shapes were found and fixed that way.

## Short posts — a post with no title, `src/content/untitled.ts`, ADR 0064

Leave the title empty and publish: it is a post in every respect — address, list, feeds,
tags, categories, newsletter — drawn by its words instead of a headline. The address is its
first six words, pinned at the first save. Wherever only a name fits (the tab, the share
card, a link) it is called by its first words; see
[ADR 0064](../decisions/0064-a-post-may-have-no-title.md) for which surface does which.

## Scheduled publishing — `src/server/scheduled.ts`, `/api/cron`, `src/utils.ts` (`isScheduled`)

- **How to schedule:** set a FUTURE publish date and hit Publish. There is no separate
  `scheduled` status — a post is "scheduled" whenever it is `published` with a date still in
  the future. The read layer already hides it: `isPublicallyVisible` (lists, search, the
  `/[slug]` page) returns false until the date is reached, so a scheduled post 404s publicly
  meanwhile. `isScheduled` is its exact complement for published posts.
- **Editor cue:** with a future date the Publish button reads **Schedule**, its toast says
  **Scheduled**, a "Scheduled for <local time>" note shows under the date field, and the live
  "View post" button is not drawn (the URL 404s until it goes live). "Preview draft" still works.
- **Going live on time:** `sweepScheduled` (called from `/api/cron`) is what makes it punctual —
  it finds posts that crossed their time in the window since the LAST sweep (`newlyLive`, a
  pure `(since, now]` window) and, when any did, calls `clearCache()`, which warms the origin
  and purges the edge behind it. The **one-minute publish tick** (`/api/cron?publish=1`) does
  this and nothing else; the **hourly** tick sweeps as a backstop and also finalizes image
  variants, prunes `render_cache` and expired sessions, and takes a snapshot when one is due.
  `PUBLISH_TICK_LOOKBACK_MS` = 6 min and `HOURLY_LOOKBACK_MS` = 65 min are the FLOOR on that
  window, used on the first sweep after a boot so a restart between two ticks cannot drop a
  crossing. ⚠ A fixed window is what this replaced, and with a tick faster than the window a
  post answered "newly live" on every tick it stayed inside: one publish cost six cache
  flushes and six edge purges. Since [ADR 0031](../decisions/0031-the-blog-winds-its-own-clock.md)
  the process runs the sweep itself (`src/server/tick.ts`: every minute for publishing, hourly
  for the rest). `/api/cron` stays for an operator who sets `CRON_INTERNAL=0` and schedules it
  from outside; the crontab in [`self-host.md`](../self-host.md) §8 fires every five minutes.

## Per-post SEO + cover + dateModified — `posts` columns, `src/web/article.ts`

- **`meta_title` / `meta_description`** override the `<title>`, meta description, and OG/Twitter
  card when set (else post title + excerpt). Set in the editor's SEO section.
- **`cover_image`** is a visible hero at the top of the post AND the OG image fallback (ahead of
  the SEO-only `featured_image`). Distinct roles: featured = social-only/hidden, cover = shown.
- **Real `dateModified`**: the meta line shows "Updated <date>" only when `updated_at` is >24h after
  `date` (so a save right after publishing adds no noise). Read through `posts.ts` `rowToMeta`
  (`updatedAt` etc.). The JSON-LD half landed on 2026-08-25 and reads the same column, with
  the same judgement in a second place: `dateModified` is emitted only when `updatedAt`
  differs from `date`, so a post that was never saved again does not claim it was edited on
  the day it appeared. See [`seo-pwa.md`](../seo-pwa.md).

## A link alone on its line — `src/render/link-cards.ts`, ADR 0058

- **One rule finds the paragraph:** a `<p>` whose whole content is one link, or one bare URL.
  Three passes read it — the video embed, the bookmark card and the file card — in that order,
  because a YouTube URL has been a player since the port and must not become a thumbnail.
- **Bookmark card** (`features.bookmarkCards`): the target's title, description and picture. The
  markdown stays a bare URL. A render that meets an unknown link writes the URL down; the minute
  tick reads five pages at a time, **once ever**, through `safeFetch`; the picture is re-encoded
  to one 400px WebP under `cards/` in this blog's own store, so a reader still loads nothing from
  a third party. Everything the far server said is escaped on the way OUT, in
  [`render/link-cards.ts`](../../src/render/link-cards.ts), never on the way in.
- **File card** (`features.fileCards`): a link to one of this blog's own `/uploads/files/…`
  becomes the file's name, `fileKind` and size, read from the `files` table. Nothing is fetched,
  and no `download` attribute is set — `web/uploads.ts` already decides that in its
  `content-disposition`.
- **The switch stops the FETCH, not just the drawing.** `sweepLinkCards` declines outright while
  `features.bookmarkCards` is off; noting a URL stays unconditional, so switching it on later
  fills in the backlog with no re-saving.
- **Both OFF on a blog that already has a settings row** (`NEW_SINCE_INSTALLS_EXISTED`), ON for a
  new one. A URL nobody has read, a page that refused, and the switch being off all render the
  same way: the plain link the paragraph already was.

## Library: Videos tab + self-hosted video — `screens/media-files.ts`, `src/render/video.ts`

- The Library page has THREE tabs ([`screens/media.ts`](../../src/web/admin/screens/media.ts),
  the shared kit's `tabs()`): **Images** (media library), **Videos**, **Files**. The Images grid
  ([`screens/media-images.ts`](../../src/web/admin/screens/media-images.ts)) has a **toolbar**:
  total count + size, a name **search**, and a **sort** (newest / name / size); each tile keeps a
  compact `dims · size · shortdate` caption and its copy / download / delete actions **overlay the
  thumbnail** (revealed on hover, always on touch) so they add no layout height. The grid is 5-across
  at desktop so the caption never truncates. Videos are ordinary attachments in the shared `files` store
  (same upload route `/api/files/attach`, same soft-delete) — `isVideoAttachment`
  (MIME `video/*`, extension fallback) splits them between the Videos tab (grid of
  native `<video controls preload="metadata">` players + copy URL) and the Files tab.
  No schema change; `FileUploader` takes `accept`/`label` for the video dropzone.
- **ONE PAGE AT A TIME** (`MEDIA_PAGE = 200`, [`views-media.ts`](../../src/web/admin/views-media.ts)):
  each tab draws 200 and a pager under the grid links to the next (`?tab=<kind>&page=<n>` — the
  link carries its own kind, because switching tabs is an attribute rather than a navigation and
  the address can be sitting on another one). Turning a page is a real navigation, so Back works
  and no tile is ever built in the browser. Images page in SQL (`getMedia({limit, offset})`);
  videos and files are one table split by a predicate, so that read is whole and the slice is in
  the view. The count and size above the grid are the WHOLE library (`countMedia()`) and do not
  move as pages turn — the island carries them on `data-media-total` and shifts them only by what
  is uploaded or deleted on the page in front of it. The name search narrows the page it is on.
- **Publishing:** copy the video URL and paste it on its own line in the editor —
  content stays 100% Markdown, exactly like YouTube/Vimeo/TikTok. The renderer
  (`PostContent buildVideos`) turns a platform URL into an iframe embed and a DIRECT
  file URL (`videoFileUrl`: http(s)/root-relative + `.mp4/.m4v/.webm/.mov`) into a
  native `<video>` (`.video-file`, column width, natural aspect). The scheme gate
  means `javascript:`/`data:` can never reach `src`. The editor's Video node previews
  both forms.
- **Serving (`handleUpload` in `src/web/uploads.ts`, on `/uploads/*`): STREAMS from disk and honours byte ranges.**
  Video seeking — and iOS Safari playback at all — needs 206 responses; the route
  parses `Range` via `src/media/http-range.ts` (pinned by `http-range.test.ts`) and pipes
  `createReadStream` into the Response, so a large video never sits in server memory
  (this also de-buffered image serving). `src/media/mime.ts` maps video/audio extensions —
  without them the fallback octet-stream makes browsers download instead of play.
- **The app's own limits (`src/media/limits.ts`): `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` (64) and
  `STORAGE_QUOTA_GB` (5).** Added 2026-08-11, when the only byte limit in the tree turned
  out to be the WXR import's. A file over the cap gets a 413 and the reason
  `file_too_large`; one that would push the store past the quota gets `quota_exceeded`.
  Both are checked from `File.size` **before** the body is read, so an oversized upload
  never becomes resident memory, and again in `blob-local.put()` — the one function every
  stored byte passes through — so a route that forgets cannot write past the ceiling.
  Settings → Server & connections → This install can lower either for this blog and can never raise it.
- **Host limits, still there and still first:** the reverse proxy caps upload size (nginx
  `client_max_body_size`), and proxies/CDNs (e.g. Cloudflare free: 100 MB) cap request
  bodies — a huge video fails at the edge, more cheaply than in the app. What the app's
  own limits add is every path a proxy never sees: a binary run behind a tunnel or nothing
  at all, and `add_media_from_url`, where the bytes arrive on a fetch the server made. For
  long/heavy video, a platform embed (unlisted YouTube/Vimeo) is still the better tool:
  transcoding + adaptive bitrate.

## WordPress import — `src/import/wordpress.ts`, Admin → Settings → Server & connections

- **One-click import** from a WordPress export (`Tools → Export → All content` = a WXR `.xml`).
  `ImportFields` uploads the file (multipart) to owner-gated `POST /api/import/wordpress`.
- **`parseWxr(xml, now)` is PURE** (no I/O; unit-tested in `src/import/wordpress.test.ts`): each `item`
  with `wp:post_type` post/page and a live status → a post/page. HTML `content:encoded` → Markdown
  (`src/import/html-to-md.ts`), `<figure><figcaption>` folded INTO the image alt (Quire Ink
  renders captions from alt). A **gallery** (`figure.wp-block-gallery`, which nests one `<figure><img>` per photo)
  emits EVERY nested image, each tagged `#grid` so `groupGalleries` rebuilds it as a grid —
  reading only the first nested image drops the rest of the gallery on the floor.
  Categories/tags split by `@_domain`, `Uncategorized` dropped; dates via `wp:post_date_gmt`
  **falling back to `wp:post_date`** (WordPress leaves the GMT date as `0000-00-00` on anything
  never published, so drafts would otherwise all import dated today) and then to `now`;
  status `publish`→`published` else `draft`; excerpt from `excerpt:encoded` or `deriveExcerpt`.
- **The route persists** via `savePost`/`savePage` — new content is ADDED, a slug that collides with
  existing content gets a numeric suffix (nothing overwritten). One `clearCache()` at the
  end; logged as `import.wordpress`. **A published item's old path becomes a 301** in the
  owner's redirects table (WXR `<link>`, Substack `/p/<slug>`; refused when it would shadow
  live content, because the redirect middleware answers before the router — ADR 0034).
- **Images come home in batches** (`src/import/images.ts`, since 2.2.1): the admin client loops
  `POST /api/import/images` after the upload — each call rescans "what is still remote?",
  fetches up to five images through the SSRF guard and the upload caps, stores them in the
  media library and rewrites every reference; the MCP `import_images` tool is the same loop
  for an agent. Stateless by rescan (a crash loses nothing; a blog imported earlier is served
  the same); failures are reported once, not retried forever — the failure list is the
  owner's checklist before the old hosting lapses. Logged as `import.images`.
- Max upload 100MB (`MAX_IMPORT_BYTES` in `src/web/admin/ops.ts`); non-WXR files are rejected.
