# Delivery

What happens between a request arriving and bytes going out: the render cache, the switch
that turns it off, the CDN purge behind it, and compression.

Split out of [`performance.md`](performance.md), which is the resource-loading law — what a
BROWSER fetches and in what order. This is the other half: what the SERVER does before it
answers. The two are read at different times and neither needed the other's detail.

## Rendering — the body cache and the warm

**Measured 2026-07-29, on the live server against a copy of the real database.** The design
assumed a re-render cost a fraction of a millisecond, which is why `clearCache()` throws
away every page on any write (Invariant 1) without a second thought. It does not:

| | |
|---|---|
| Cold article render | **92–383 ms** across the archive |
| An 85,000-character post | **364 ms**, of which `renderPostContent` is **359 ms** |
| Inside that, `marked.parse` | **360 ms** — marked itself, not our renderer or our options: a plain `Marked` with no configuration measures 375 ms on the same input |

So the rendered body is cached, keyed by the **build commit + the media facts + the
markdown**. Nothing invalidates it: a change is a different key, and a different key misses.
See `docs/spec/01-schema.md` §4 for why the argument against caching it was wrong.

It sat in `render_cache` beside the highlighter until ADR 0062, on the same content-addressed
terms, and that is how a production blog came to hold **502 MB of HTML that no reader could
reach** — the build commit is in the key, so every deploy stranded a whole generation and only
age could collect it. The body lives in `body_cache` now, **one row per piece**: the same hash
still decides hit from miss, but it is a column, so a fresh render takes the row the last one
had. Highlighting stays content-addressed, being shared between pieces.

Measured after, same server, same post: **383 ms → 1 ms** with the page cache cold and the
body cache warm, and the full 74-page warm sweep **3,948 ms → 203 ms**.

**Three rules for this cache:**

- **The build commit is in the key.** A deploy that changes any transform in
  `post-content.ts` must not serve yesterday's HTML out of a cache that cannot tell. A
  hand-maintained version constant would have been free and would eventually be forgotten.
- **It is never load-bearing.** A read that throws returns null and the page renders the
  slow way. Tested with the table dropped.
- **`clearCache()` does not touch it.** Its hash decides hit from miss; a stale row is inert.

### The budget

The page cache holds rendered HTML in memory and had no ceiling: the warmer renders every
public post into it at boot and after every write, so a big archive kept every page whether
or not anybody ever asked for one. Measured 2026-09-21 in a container, 1,000 posts,
`--memory=128m --cpus=0.25`:

| | memory | boot warm | an article |
|---|---|---|---|
| unbounded, as it shipped | **117.6 MB of 128**, OOM-killed on 2 of 3 restarts | 74.6 s | ~10 ms |
| the same box, cache off | 44.8 MB idle, 66.3 MB after reads | none | 46–98 ms |
| `PAGE_CACHE_MB=8` (the default) | 89.5 MB, 330 pages warmed | 23.3 s | ~10 ms warm, 46–98 ms cold |
| `PAGE_CACHE_MB=2` | 74.9 MB, 82 pages warmed | 6.3 s | as above |

So the cache is a budget in bytes now, `PAGE_CACHE_MB` (`env.ts`), 8 MB by default. Three
rules, each pinned by a test in `src/server/cache.test.ts`:

- **Eviction is least-recently-READ.** Insertion order alone would let a crawler walking a
  900-post archive push the front page out, which is the one page certain to be asked for
  again.
- **A warm never evicts.** It renders in priority order — `/`, then the static pages, then
  posts newest first — and `offer()` refuses a page rather than throwing away one an earlier
  lap already paid for. `set()`, the reader's path, does evict: that page was asked for.
- **`0` means no cache**, unlike `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` and `STORAGE_QUOTA_GB`, where `0` means no
  limit. A cache with no room is not a cache with an infinite one.

**What the machine has to be, then.** Same fixture, same quarter of a CPU, memory alone varied:

| the box | serving | cutting an upload's smaller copies |
|---|---|---|
| 128 MB | 56 MB resident, a page in 5–37 ms | **OOM-killed** |
| 160 MB | fine | **OOM-killed** |
| 192 MB | fine | runs at 90–93 MB; an encode may be killed and retried |
| 256 MB | 119 MB resident, a page in 5–6 ms | finishes |

So **192 MB is the floor and 256 MB is what to give it**, and the floor is set by libvips
encoding AVIF rather than by anything this code does per request: a blog with no pictures, or
one whose pictures are already cut, runs in a third of it. The failure is worth knowing by
shape — it lands two minutes after a boot that looked healthy, because that is when the first
full tick sweeps for pending variants.

That sweep encodes each variant in a child process ([ADR 0061](decisions/0061-the-image-codec-runs-in-a-child-process.md)),
which is what moved the floor from 256 and, more usefully, changed what happens when it is
reached: one run at 192 MB logged `encode 1600.avif exited null (SIGKILL)` while `/api/health`
went on answering 200 and the pending rows waited for the next tick. The kernel killed the
encoder instead of the blog.

The serving half fits because the image runs `bun --smol`. JavaScriptCore sizes its heap from
the MACHINE's memory and cannot see a cgroup limit, so inside `--memory=128m` on an 8 GB host it
believes it has 8 GB: measured on that fixture, the default heap sat at 121.5 MB of 128 pinned
at 100% of its CPU with the boot warm **still unfinished after twenty minutes** and the home
page taking 16.5 seconds, against 55.1 MB, 0.05% CPU and 379 ms with `--smol`. It is never
OOM-killed in that state, so nothing restarts it. The flag costs nothing where there is room —
3,000 requests at 32 concurrent on 2 GB and 2 CPUs ran 4,995 and 5,115 req/s by default against
5,962 and 6,234 with it, p50 5.4 ms against 4.3 — so it is the default everywhere the process is
started: the image, `bun start`, `install.sh` and the systemd unit.

A blog of ordinary size never reaches the budget — 100 posts of that fixture come to 2.4 MB —
so nothing about it is observable until an archive outgrows the memory it is running on.

### The third ceiling: SQLite's own cache

The page cache is a measured budget and the heap has `--smol`, and until 2026-09-23 the
`cache_size` PRAGMA beside them was a number nobody had measured. It is a ceiling **per
connection** and `openDatabases` opens two, so one line offered 128 MB to a process this
project also ships in a 128 MB container.

Measured against a 314 MB database, 20,000 point lookups, three runs each, in
`--memory=128m --cpus=0.5` with the file on native container storage — through a bind mount
the same work ran 377 to 1,731 ms and said nothing, which is worth knowing before anybody
repeats this:

| `cache_size` | Resident added | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `-64000` (64 MB) | +57.0 / +56.8 / +56.9 MB | 181 / 189 / 188 ms |
| **`-16000` (16 MB)** | +43.1 / +43.0 / +43.3 MB | **142 / 146 / 132 ms** |
| `-8000` | +26.4 / +34.5 / +33.8 MB | 142 / 81 / 104 ms |
| `-2000` | +27.4 / +27.5 / +27.5 MB | 141 / 126 / 108 ms |

**64 MB was the slowest of the four, in every run, by about 30%.** Inside a memory limit
SQLite's private cache and the kernel's page cache come out of the same allowance, so a large
private cache buys a second copy of pages it has just pushed the kernel into dropping. On an
unconstrained machine the four are indistinguishable (121 / 127 / 120 / 121 ms), so a large
server gives up nothing either.

It is 16 MB and not the 2 MB that measured as well, because what was measured is point lookups
by primary key: the request path also runs FTS search, taxonomy joins and the analytics join
across the ATTACHed file, and those are the shapes a page cache actually helps. None of them is
in the table above, so the headroom stays until something measures them.

A database smaller than the cache — which is nearly every blog — behaves identically either
way; the whole file was held before and is held now.

### The switch

Both layers can be turned off together in **Settings → Server & connections → This install**
(`settings.cache.enabled`), for the hour you are changing the design and want to see what
you changed. Off means:

- `cached()` neither reads nor **writes** the page cache. Filling it while it is off would
  hand back an hour-old page the moment it was switched back on.
- Public HTML goes out `public, no-store` instead of `s-maxage=60`. `no-store`, not
  `no-cache`: Cloudflare treats `no-cache` as "keep it, revalidate" and keeps answering
  from the edge, so a switch that sent it would look broken from outside.
- The warmer returns immediately instead of rendering the archive into a cache nobody reads.

Nothing about Invariant 1 changes: when the cache is on, a write still empties all of it.
The switch decides whether there is a cache at all, not how it is invalidated. Pinned by
`src/web/app.test.ts` ("switched off in Settings").

### `/sw.js` and the edge

The service worker ([ADR 0039](decisions/0039-the-blog-reads-without-the-network.md)) is the
one script whose staleness a reader cannot fix by reloading — a browser keeps serving from
the worker it already has. It leaves the origin `no-cache`, and the build rides in
`?v=<hash>`, which is what protects it at the edge: Cloudflare's standard cache level keys on
the query string, so a deploy asks for a URL nothing has ever cached. **If a `sw.js` is ever
seen surviving a deploy, look at the cache key before looking at the worker.**

### The warm, and the CDN purge

`clearCache()` carries a hook list, and `src/index.ts` registers a debounced
warm-then-purge (`server/warm.ts`). Warm FIRST, purge second, so the edge refetches into a
warm origin. It runs on boot too, which is what makes a deploy clear the edge without
anyone remembering to.

**The hooks are registered from the entry point, never from inside `clearCache()`.** A test
suite flushes several hundred times and must get a plain `Map.clear()`; a CLI must not be
left holding a timer open.

`purgeEdge()` (`server/edge-cache.ts`) uses `cloudflareApiToken` + `cloudflareZoneId` from
`integration_keys`; unconfigured is a no-op, which is the normal state of a self-hosted install.

**And any other CDN** ([ADR 0033](decisions/0033-purging-an-edge-that-is-not-cloudflare.md)):
`purgeWebhookUrl` is one URL the blog POSTs `{"purge":"everything","source":"quireink"}` to
on the same occasions. Both fire when both are set, because they are two edges in front of
one blog rather than two names for one edge. It is not a provider list on purpose — Bunny,
Fastly and a script in front of nginx differ in the URL and the header and agree on
answering a POST — and the URL is treated as a secret and never logged, because a purge
endpoint usually carries its own token.

It is the **only** purge path: the scheduled sweep, `/api/cron?purge=1` and the admin cache
button all call it.

## Compression

`Bun.serve` sends exactly what a handler returns and nothing set `content-encoding`, so the
stylesheet, every page and every feed left the origin raw. `web/compress.ts` compresses text
responses over 1 KB when the client asked, and sets `Vary: Accept-Encoding`. Nothing under
`/api/` is compressed except the search index (`/api/search/index`).

Ratio, not size, is the point: **61 KB → 19.5 KB** when it shipped, and `site.css` is about
**10 KB compressed** today, after the minifier and ADR 0027 took the pen's ink out of it. On the hashed immutable assets a reader sees this DIRECTLY, because a CDN passes
the origin's encoding straight through on them (measured below); on HTML the CDN re-compresses,
so what this buys there is the origin-to-edge fetch, on every cache miss and on every purge
above. An install with no CDN in front of it sees all of it, everywhere. Binary bodies are left alone: an image
or a font is already compressed and gzipping it spends CPU to add bytes.

### The same bytes are only gzipped once

The middleware runs OUTSIDE the page cache, which stores HTML strings — so a cache hit still
paid a full gzip, and `/assets/site.<hash>.css`, which cannot change for the life of a build,
paid one on every single request. Requests per second on a warm local instance:

| | off | on, re-gzipping | on, memoised |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Front page | 5,510 | 3,325 | **4,445** |
| Article | 4,897 | 3,509 | **4,943** |
| `site.<hash>.css` | 11,216 | 3,652 | **8,139** |

Compressed bodies are kept in a map keyed by the CONTENT — the byte length and a `Bun.hash`
of the body — rather than by path. Same bytes in, same bytes out, so a write that empties the
page cache has nothing to invalidate here, which is what makes the map safe to keep at all.
Hashing costs 0.006 ms on a 31 KB page against 0.090 ms to gzip it.

### Brotli first, gzip behind it

This said **not Brotli** until 2026-09-01, on two grounds. Both were re-measured and neither
held.

The first was that brotli saves about 3%. True at quality 4, which is the worst rung on the
ladder. The whole sweep, on one article page against its own gzip:

| brotli q | bytes | ms | vs gzip-6 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 7,766 | 0.7 | −1.4% |
| **5** | **7,275** | **0.5** | **−7.7%** |
| 9 | 7,238 | 0.8 | −8.1% |
| **11** | **6,494** | **23.4** | **−17.6%** |

q5 is both better and faster than q4. And on the sheets, which are SVG data-URIs by the
hundred, a wide window changes the answer entirely:

| | gzip-6 | brotli-11 | zstd-19 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `site.css` | 10,907 | **9,681** (−11%) | 10,300 |
| `pen-marks.css` | 11,838 | **5,928** (−50%) | 6,732 |
| `pen-lines.css` | 8,664 | **5,368** (−38%) | 6,236 |
| `core.js` | 4,153 | **3,556** (−14%) | 4,068 |
| `post.js` | 6,519 | **5,690** (−13%) | 6,371 |
| One article page | 7,879 | **6,494** (−18%) | 7,502 |
| **A cold visit** | **49,960** | **36,717 (−27%)** | 41,209 (−18%) |

The second ground was that the CDN re-compresses anyway. Half true, and the wrong half.
Measured against a live install behind Cloudflare: the HTML came back `content-encoding:
zstd`, so that hop is re-done — but `/assets/site.<hash>.css` came back `cf-cache-status:
HIT, content-encoding: gzip, content-length: 10907`, byte for byte the origin's own gzip,
passed straight through. **The hashed immutable assets keep whatever the origin gave them**,
and they are precisely what every first-time reader downloads. An install with no CDN in
front of it kept the worse encoding for everything.

**Quality is chosen per response, and `immutable` is the first half of the signal.** The asset
routes set their own `cache-control` inside the handler, while `cacheHeaders` fills in
everything else after the compression middleware has run — so a response that says immutable
really is one of the hashed artefacts, compressed once on its first request and served from
the map for the life of the process. That makes q11's 41–94 ms a one-off. A page is a new body
on every write, so it gets q5, which is the rung that pays for itself per distinct body.

**The second half is a 192 KB ceiling, and the tour is what found it.** `immutable` was the
whole test to begin with, which was right about the public sheets and wrong about what else
wears the label: the admin's own chunks are hashed and immutable too, and twenty times the
size. The admin's entry chunk takes **642 ms** at q11 against 11 ms at q5, and `admin.css`
279 ms. Compression was synchronous then, so the first load of the admin stalled the entire
process for over a second, and a reader asking for a page in that window waited exactly as long.

Two things came out of that. **The expensive rung moved off the event loop:** measured with a
10 ms interval running alongside, `brotliCompressSync` on that bundle let 1 tick through and
the async form let 59 through over the same 643 ms. The work costs the same either way; only
one of them bills everybody else for it.

Only q11 goes to the pool, though, and that is a memory decision. A libuv worker that has run
a brotli job keeps its allocator arena afterwards. Physical footprint of one warm instance
after the same 2,000 requests: **gzip only 119 MB, every brotli through the pool 179 MB, only
q11 through it 151 MB.** q5 costs 0.5 ms on an article page, which is worth neither a thread
nor 28 MB. The 32 MB that remains is what brotli costs this process, and it is the price of
the 22% off every cold visit.

And **q11 stopped applying above 192 KB**, which is a
judgement about who pays: q11 buys 12.5% over q5 on that bundle and 14.2% on the admin sheet,
and it spends most of a CPU second on a machine that may only have one, for an artefact one
person downloads once. 192 KB sits above every public asset (the largest is a pen sheet at
138,375 bytes raw) and below the admin's two large files, the editor's `sheet` island and
`admin-ink.css`; `admin.css`, 136 KB since the pen left it, now takes q11. It is a gap, not a knife-edge, and
`qualityFor` is exported so a test pins both ends of it.

The map holds the PROMISE rather than the bytes, which the asynchronous compressor made
necessary: two requests arriving for the same uncompressed body would otherwise each start
their own 600 ms of work.

**zstd is not offered.** On the same six responses it saves 18% against brotli's 27%, and
Safari does not send it at all.

`Accept-Encoding` is parsed rather than substring-matched, because `br;q=0` is how a client
says it would rather not and `includes('br')` reads that as yes.

### A returning reader is answered with nothing

Measured on a warm browser cache: every stylesheet, script and font came back from disk at
zero bytes, and the HTML was fetched again in full — **8,179 bytes per page view** — because
no response carried anything to revalidate against. A page's `cache-control` is
`s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=600`, which is instruction for a shared cache with no
freshness for the browser, so the browser asks every time; without a validator every ask is a
whole page.

Every 200 now carries a strong `ETag`, and `If-None-Match` is answered **304**. It is derived
from the UNCOMPRESSED bytes and then labelled with the encoding, because a strong tag names
one representation: the gzip and the brotli of a page are different byte streams and must not
answer each other's conditional request.

**What makes it work is that pages are byte-stable, and that is not obvious.** The comment
form carries a signed spam challenge with a salt and a timestamp in it, minted when the page
is RENDERED rather than when it is served — so two fetches of one URL from one process are
identical (verified on the front page, a post, a post with galleries, and the feed). A write
re-renders, mints a new salt, and changes the tag, which is correct: the body did change.
There is a test pinning that stability; if it ever goes red the 304 has stopped firing.

A 404 gets no tag: `cacheHeaders` marks it `private, no-store`, so nothing keeps it and
nothing would ever revalidate it.

A **404 is compressed too**, which it was not: it is 19,650 bytes of rendered site shell and
it is deliberately not page-cached, so a crawler walking dead links paid for all of it every
time. A **206 is not**, and must never be: a range response describes a slice of the original,
and compressing the slice makes `content-range` a lie.
