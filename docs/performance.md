# Performance — resource loading (fonts · CSS · JS)

One principle underlies all three: **a reader downloads only what the visible page needs,
when it needs it — nothing for a feature that's off, a surface they're not on, a font glyph
they won't see, or a browser they're not using.** The public money path is the reading
page; the admin is never on its critical path.

## Images — one gets priority, and it is the one in the first screen

On a post the LCP element is the title (the fonts rule below). **On the composed front page it
is the lead's picture** — measured at y=411 in a 1000px viewport and y=606 in an 812px one, so
inside the first screen on a laptop and on a phone. `front-card.ts` marked EVERY picture
`loading="lazy"`, the lead's included, which takes it out of the preload scanner's reach and
costs a round trip on the one image the page is judged by.

**The rule: exactly one image per page gets `fetchpriority="high"`, everything else gets
`loading="lazy"`** — `fetchpriority` on everything is `fetchpriority` on nothing. Three places
decide it and they now agree: the front page lead (`front-card.ts`, image kind only), the
first body image (`render/figures.ts`, `seen === 0`), and the light site logo
(`chrome.ts`; never the dark mark, since both ship and only one can be the LCP element).

## Fonts — preload ONLY what the LCP text needs

The LCP element on a post is the **title**, set in the **reading font** (`--font-reading`).
The **chrome font** (`--font-sans`: header/footer/rail/meta/admin) is never the LCP element.
All faces are self-hosted, subset by `unicode-range`, and declared `font-display: swap`, so
the title always paints instantly in a fallback and the web font swaps in. `<link
rel="preload">` exists ONLY to remove that one swap on the LCP title — so we preload exactly
the file(s) that paint it, and nothing else.

**`sizes` states the shape's real width, and there are four shapes.** Every picture used to
promise `100vw` on a phone and 768px above — true of one that HOLDS the reading column and
false of the other three. Measured 2026-08-28: a gallery tile renders at 167px on a 390px
phone and was fetching the 1024 file. `render/figures.ts` now answers per shape (column 672px ·
`#third` 202px · `#wide` 800px · a tile from its column count, which only exists once
`groupGalleries` has counted the run). **A third width, 512, joined 1024/1600** for the same
reason: 1024 was already the smaller answer for a picture holding the column and far too big
for anything else. Measured over the demo fixture's 18 pictures, 1,198 KB of 1024s against
365 KB of 512s — **70% less** for what a phone actually draws, at about 8% more stored bytes.
Which widths an original HAS is `media.variants`, a version rather than a flag, because a
`<picture>` naming a file that is not there fails outright instead of falling back; the
ordinary sweep upgrades old images, so nothing needs re-uploading.

**The swap must move nothing, and that takes TWO fallback twins per family.** Every text
family declares metric-matched twins (`FALLBACKS` in `src/render/font-faces.ts`) — a local
face reshaped with `size-adjust` / `ascent-override` / `descent-override` to the shipped
family's own measurements, so the line breaks during the swap window are the line breaks
after it. The first twin is Georgia or Arial and covers macOS, Windows and iOS. **The second
is Noto Serif or Roboto and covers Android, which has neither of the first two** — without
it `local()` misses, the stack falls through to an unadjusted generic, and the swap reflows
the page: measured 2026-08-28 on the demo at 390px, the document stood **6,390px against
6,921px**, so everything below the first block sat half a screen too high and then dropped.
The numbers come from `scripts/ops/font-fallback-metrics.py`, which measures both twins;
each needs its OWN, because one `size-adjust` cannot describe two local faces of different
width. Order in the stack is the platform test — first name the device HAS, wins.

**The rule — one place, `fontPreloadHrefs(fontPreset, language, hasCustomFont, chromeFont)`
in `src/content/fonts.ts`, called once in `src/web/layout.ts`:**

| Case | Preload |
|---|---|
| Built-in reading font, latin locale (`en`, `de`) | `‹slug›-latin.woff2` |
| Built-in reading font, `vi` | `‹slug›-latin.woff2` **and** `‹slug›-vietnamese.woff2` (a VN title needs both unicode-ranges) |
| Built-in reading font, CJK locale (`ja`, `zh`, `ko`) **or `ru`** | **nothing** — the built-ins ship no CJK glyphs and never will (a CJK webfont is megabytes), so the title renders in a system face; a latin preload it won't use only steals bandwidth. Which system face is not left to the browser: every reading stack ends in a NAMED CJK tail, one per language, selected by `cjkLangCss` on `:lang(zh\|ja\|ko)`. Zero bytes downloaded — see `CJK_ZH` / `CJK_JA` / `CJK_KO` in `src/content/fonts.ts` |
| **Uploaded custom font** (`settings.customFont`) | **nothing** — the face is unsubsetted (whole charset, often large); a high-priority preload would contend with the render-blocking CSS and hurt LCP. It still wins `--font-reading` via `fontToCss`; `swap` covers the paint |
| **Chrome font**, when it is a self-hosted family of its own (JetBrains Mono default, IBM Plex Mono, Inter) | **its own subset(s), same rule as the reading font** — and this row USED to read "never, it is not the LCP element". That was written when the chrome face was Inter: the fallback was a system sans and the swap was barely visible. It is a MONOSPACE on any site that picked one, and the header, the meta line and both rails all re-flow when it lands. Measured before the change (origin, cold, 4× CPU throttle); the reading font still wins the race and is still declared first. One exception, and it cost 160 ms of LCP to find: an install that has never CHOSEN a chrome font is using the reading face, so `isChromeFontId` gates this — `getChromeFont` falls back to Inter for an unknown id, which is right for the font stack and wrong here, because it preloads 44 KB the page will not paint a glyph in |

### Variation axes are trimmed, not shipped whole

`wght` is clamped to 400-700 and **`opsz` is pinned to 18** ([ADR 0009](decisions/0009-pin-optical-size-axis.md)),
and the command that does it is [`scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py`](../scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py):

```
pip install fonttools brotli zopfli
python3 scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py --check    # report, write nothing
python3 scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py --write    # rebuild the files
```

It pulls the upstream faces, instances the axes, subsets to the ranges
[`src/render/font-faces.ts`](../src/render/font-faces.ts) declares, and refuses to write a
file that lost a positioning feature or a declared codepoint. Both of those guards exist
because both failures happened while it was being written: an explicit `--layout-features`
list drops `kern`/`mark`/`mkmk` and yields a font that measures 26% smaller and sets badly,
and a Vietnamese subset with no combining marks silently loses mark attachment.

The `opsz` axis doubled the two book serifs. Literata carries 42% fewer glyphs than Inter
yet was 2.2× its size, entirely because `gvar` must store deltas for every glyph across
the optical range:

| File | Before | After | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `literata-latin` | 80,660 | **37,560** | −53% |
| `literata-vietnamese` | 16,928 | **8,652** | −49% |
| `sourceserif-latin` | 83,240 | **36,160** | −56% |
| **a real preload set** (Literata + `language: vi`) | **97,588** | **46,212** | **−53%** |

That last row is the whole point: an install running Literata with `language: vi` preloads
`literata-latin` **plus** `literata-vietnamese` for the LCP, so this change takes **51 KB**
off its critical path. Any non-Latin language pairs the same way.

> ⚠️ **Measure production, not a local build.** A local `.env` points at a dev database whose
> `settings` row differs from the live one. During this work a local build reported the
> preset as Inter with `lang="en"`, which is not what the site serves. Anything that depends
> on `settings` (font preset, language, palette, enabled features) must be read off the server:
> `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep -o -- '--font-reading:[^;}]*'`.

Narrowing the range instead was measured and is not competitive (`12-24` still costs
58 KB). 18 was chosen by rendering 14/18/24 side by side: body copy is 18px, so pinning at
18 leaves the body **identical** to what `font-optical-sizing: auto` produced, and body is
where reading time goes. The cost is a 36px title rendering in the 18pt design, slightly
heavier than before. `font-optical-sizing: auto` stays in the public sheet because an
uploaded custom font can still have the axis.

Hard invariants (also in [`conventions/type.md`](./conventions/type.md)):
- **Self-hosted only.** No runtime or build-time fetch to Google (it broke offline/CI).
  Files in `src/assets/static/fonts/`, served at `/fonts/*` by `src/web/static.ts`, subset
  `-latin` / `-latin-ext` / `-vietnamese`.
- **Never preload `latin-ext` or a specific weight.** Built-in reading fonts are variable
  (one file per subset carries every weight); `latin-ext` glyphs are rare and load on demand. The pen's `kalam-digits` (numbered lists) is never preloaded either: 1.4 KB, fetched only when a numeral renders.
- **Preload the chrome font only when it is a self-hosted family of its own** (`isChromeFontId`
  decides); `chromeFont: 'reading'` preloads nothing extra. The table above has the
  measurement, and the trap: `getChromeFont` falls back to Inter for an unknown id, which is
  right for the font stack and costs 160 ms as a preload.
- Changing which subsets exist? Keep `fontPreloadHrefs`, the `@font-face` `unicode-range`
  blocks (`src/render/font-faces.ts`) and the served file list (`src/web/static.ts`) in sync.

## CSS — hashed sheets, plus the settings inline

**Measured 2026-07-29.** The whole stylesheet used to be inlined into every page. That
removes one round trip on a COLD visit and charges for it on every visit after: of the
48.7 KB assembled per page, **42.6 KB (13.8 KB gzipped) was byte-identical everywhere**
and only 6.1 KB (1.7 KB gzipped) actually varied with the owner's settings. Reading three
articles re-sent 41 KB of gzipped CSS carrying one page's worth of information, and none of
it could be cached, because it was not a resource.

So the two halves are split at exactly that seam:

| Half | Where | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Static rules (`PUBLIC_CSS`) | `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/site.‹hash›.css">` | one request, `immutable` for a year; the hash changes when the bytes do |
| Settings (fonts, `--shell-w`, rail geometry, palette, type roles, custom CSS) | inline `<style>`, immediately AFTER the link | ~1.7 KB gzipped per page |

The order is the load-bearing part: the inline block is allowed to WIN, so it has to come
second, exactly where it sat when the two were one string.

### The pen rides in two more sheets, and only boards the pages that used it

**Measured 2026-08-21** ([ADR 0027](./decisions/0027-the-pen-ships-only-where-it-wrote.md)):
the pen's ink — 280 SVG data-URIs after 0025/0026 — had grown to ~21 of `site.css`'s 29 KB
gzipped, paid by every page including the ones with no ink on them. It now ships as
`pen-marks.‹hash›.css` (the highlighter) and `pen-lines.‹hash›.css` (underline and ring),
same immutable footing, linked render-blocking right after `site.css` — but only when
`penSheetsFor` (`web/assets.ts`) finds the elements they paint in the page's HTML. After
the split `site.css` is **7.6 KB gzipped**; an inkless page carries nothing of the pen, a
marked page carries exactly what it shows, and no page's pixels or paint order change. Since [ADR 0042](./decisions/0042-the-pen-inks-unevenly.md) the two sheets weigh **19.6 KB and 15.2 KB gzipped**: each stroke carries its felt, a filter and a gradient inside the data-URI.
Deferred loading was rejected: a stylesheet that arrives late shows bare words before the
ink lands.

Measured after (origin, `127.0.0.1`, median of three cold loads): HTML per page **60.3 KB
→ 20.7 KB** on the home page and **65.0 KB → 25.4 KB** on a post; the sheet is discovered
at ~11 ms and done at ~18 ms; LCP 100 ms home / 132 ms post; CLS 0. A loopback measurement
cannot price the extra round trip a real network charges on the FIRST visit — that is the
cost this trade accepts, and it is paid once.

### The sheet is minified before it is hashed

**Measured 2026-07-30**, against the live site: the served sheet was **65,645 bytes raw, of
which 34,438 were comment text** — 52% of it — and 20,903 bytes compressed. These sheets are
commented the way the rest of the codebase is, and that is worth keeping; it was worth
keeping in the `.ts` file rather than on the wire. `web/css-min.ts` strips comments and
collapses whitespace once at module init, and `PUBLIC_SHEET` hashes the MINIFIED bytes:
**30,811 raw / 6,519 compressed**, a saving of 14.4 KB on every cold visit, which is more
than the whole JavaScript budget for a page.

The minifier is hand-written and string-aware because two things in this sheet break a naive
one, and both break it silently:

- **A quoted string may contain anything.** The book-mode paper grain is a `data:image/svg+xml`
  URI full of spaces and slashes; `content:"("` exists too.
- **Whitespace is load-bearing next to a colon and inside `calc()`.** `.book-flow :is(img,…)`
  is a DESCENDANT selector, and deleting that one space silently rewrites it to
  `.book-flow:is(…)`, which matches something else. So whitespace collapses to nothing only
  beside `{ } ; ,` and to a single space everywhere else.

It found a bug on the way in: `ide.css.ts` carried a paragraph of prose with a closing `*/`
and **no opener**, so a browser read the prose as a selector, failed, and discarded the rule
that followed it — seven selectors meant to darken every count and date under the source-code look,
which had therefore never applied. `check:css` (`scripts/checks/css-literal.ts`) now counts `/*` against `*/` in every
sheet, because nothing about that failure was visible: no error, no log, and the sheet reads
correctly in the editor.

**The check DISCOVERS the sheets; it does not keep a list of them.** It used to, and the
list went stale three times — the third time it reported "ok (6 sheets)" while `front.css.ts`
and `utility.css.ts` had never been read, and a backtick in one of them was caught by the
type checker instead. `check:type` had the same list and the same hole (`mobile.css.ts`
was never in it). Both now scan `src/web/*.css.ts`, so a new sheet is covered the moment the
file exists, and the old rule "add a new sheet to the check in the same commit" is gone
along with the way to forget it. `type-roles` keeps ONE exclusion, `login.css.ts`, because
the sign-in page renders with no base sheet and a role reference there resolves to nothing.

### A fourth sheet: the phone

`web/mobile.css.ts` is appended after the islands and the motion engine, and
before print, because several of its rules win on a specificity tie alone. `book-phone.css.ts`
is the second phone sheet: the scrolled book reader that replaces the spread under 640px. The seam is a real one rather than a split at
the line limit: a phone is not a narrow desktop. It carries the 16px floor on form controls
(below that, iOS Safari zooms the page on focus and the site's small role is 14px),
thumb-sized padding on the drawer rows and the tag cloud, `@media (hover:none)` for the
copy-code button that was invisible on touch, a faint scrim behind the drawer, and the
`env(safe-area-inset-*)` offsets. Nothing in it matches above 639px, so the desktop keeps
the geometry it was measured into — verified by measuring the same element at both widths.

### Dark before the island runs

`.dark` is applied by `assets/js/theme.ts`, a DEFERRED module — so for the length of one
paint the page is whatever CSS alone can decide, and the sheet had no `prefers-color-scheme`
rule at all (measured: 0 of 429). `system` is the default mode, so **every reader whose
machine is dark was shown a white page on every navigation.**

The handoff is `data-scheme` on `<html>`:

- `themesToCss(themes, defaultId, enabled, defaultScheme)` decides WHICH rule from the owner's
  `defaultScheme` setting (Admin → Appearance → Default appearance): **`system`** emits
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root:not([data-scheme]){…}}` after the base tokens —
  follow the visitor's OS, and the case the rest of this section describes; **`dark`** emits the
  same declaration UNCONDITIONALLY, so every first-time visitor opens dark whatever their laptop
  says; **`light`** emits nothing, because `:root` already carries the light palette. All three
  require `data-scheme` to be ABSENT, which is what keeps a reader's own choice untouchable.
  `:root:not([data-scheme])` is 0,2,0 — above `:root` and `[data-palette=…]`, and never in a
  fight with `.dark`, which only exists once `data-scheme` does.
- The island sets `data-scheme` to the RESOLVED `light`/`dark` on its FIRST apply, not only
  when the reader picks something. `system` and `time` are questions; the attribute has to
  be an answer or the CSS cannot use it.
- `color-scheme` rides along, which is what makes the scrollbar and the form controls follow
  the page instead of staying light under a dark one.

Nothing server-rendered sets `data-scheme` and nothing may: the page cache is keyed by URL
alone ([invariant 1](invariants.md)), so a server-rendered mode would be the first visitor's
mode for everyone.

The honest cost: a reader who explicitly chose LIGHT on a dark machine now gets the inverse
flash, for exactly as long as the dark reader used to get theirs. That moves it off the
common case and onto the rare one. Removing it altogether needs an inline script, which this
project does not have anywhere and asserts it does not.

## The two sheets — a reader never loads admin CSS

The split is now by implementation, not by a scanner's `@source` list, which is what
[ADR 0008](./decisions/0008-hand-written-css-no-tailwind-public.md) bought:

- **Public** — hand-written `src/web/*.css.ts`, assembled into `PUBLIC_CSS` and served as
  the `site.css` sheet above. No Tailwind, no scanner, so an admin utility cannot leak into
  it by accident.
- **Admin** — `src/admin/utilities.css` and `src/admin/admin.css`, concatenated in that order
  and minified by `scripts/build-admin.ts`, served under `/admin/assets/*`. The utilities, the
  reset and the design tokens were captured once from the Tailwind CLI and kept as plain CSS
  (ADR 0053); the chrome goes second because its rules are unlayered and the utilities sit in
  `@layer utilities`, which is what lets the chrome win. A reader never requests that path, so
  its size is the owner's problem alone.

`PROSE_CSS` and the pen's `INK_CSS` are the sheets both need, so each is defined once in a
`.ts` module (a CSS file cannot import one). The build appends `PROSE_CSS` to `admin.css` and
writes the ink to `admin-ink.css`, linked only on the three writing screens (`Screen.pen`).

**Rule:** an admin-only rule never goes in a `src/web/*.css.ts` sheet.

### The admin's size is the owner's problem, but not on every load

Not budgeted (ADR 0054) — but "the owner pays it" is not the same as "the owner pays it
again every time". Two things were wrong and both are cheap:

- The entry and `admin.css` went out `no-cache` with **no validator at all**, so 262 KB came
  down on every admin load while the twelve hashed chunks beside them were `immutable` and
  free. Both now carry a hash, but from two different places, and the difference is a bug that
  shipped. The SHEET's is computed from the bytes in `web/admin/spa.ts` (`build-admin.ts`
  writes that file with `Bun.write` rather than emitting it from `Bun.build`, so there is no
  bundler hash to use) and the bare `admin.css` still serves and still revalidates. The
  ENTRY's is the BUNDLER's: `build-admin.ts` names each island
  `<name>.<hash>.js`, with a dot, so it stays distinguishable from the `island-*` chunks.

  ⚠️ The entry used to be fingerprinted the same way as the sheet — served as `main.<hash>.js`
  over a file the bundler had called `main.js` — and 2.2.8 shipped a blank admin because of
  it. **A JavaScript module is identified by the URL it was fetched from.** Bun 1.4 began
  emitting `from"./main.js"` inside every lazy route chunk where 1.3 emitted none, so the
  browser held the entry twice: once as the shell's `main.<hash>.js`, once as the chunk's
  `main.js`. Two module records are two copies of React, and the first lazy screen to call a
  hook threw React error #321 against a dispatcher belonging to the other copy. A name the
  server invents is safe for a stylesheet and never safe for a module. `check:bundle`
  now reads the built directory for exactly one rail entry and no dangling import.
- The shell linked the entry and nothing else, so the browser found the module graph one
  level at a time. Measured on the dashboard: **four waves, at 4 / 13 / 24 / 31 ms** — on
  localhost, where a hop costs a millisecond; on a real connection, four round trips of blank
  screen. `spa.ts` now walks the rail entry's STATIC imports transitively at startup and emits a
  `modulepreload` for each. **Three waves**, and the six boot chunks start with the entry
  rather than after it. The two that remain are the lazy route and its own deps, which is
  what code-splitting by route means.

- The static graph carried two things nobody asked for: all eleven READER dictionaries, through
  a type import that pulled the module, and Tiptap through a `PostSettings` type. **1,063 KB
  before the first frame became 375 KB** (2026-09-07); the other ten dictionaries arrive on
  demand, and `check:bundle` fails on a reader dictionary back in any admin bundle.

Dynamic imports are deliberately NOT preloaded: arrange mode is a dynamic import the owner may
never open, and preloading it would trade one problem for a worse one.

## JS — ship only what's used, only when it's used

1. **Five bundles on public pages, plus `login.js` on the sign-in page and the service worker
   `sw.js`, and a budget in a test.** `core.js` on every public page, `post.js` on an article,
   **`book-mode.js` / `comment-thread.js` / `reader-pen.js` only on an article whose switch is on**
   (`articleScripts()` in `web/assets.ts` emits the tag or does not); `scripts/build-assets.ts` builds them
   from `src/assets/js/` and FAILS the build when any passes the byte budget written beside
   it. There is no framework baseline to hide inside, which is the point of the whole rewrite.
2. **Every island gates itself on its own DOM hook** and returns immediately when it is
   absent — `toc()` on `.toc`, `lightbox()` on the images. A feature the owner turned off
   renders no markup, so its island costs one failed `querySelector`. That was the whole
   argument for one bundle until 2026-09-06, when it was measured: book mode and the comment
   thread were 7.8 KB and 7.0 KB of a 19.6 KB `post.js`, three quarters of the file on two
   switches. **An island behind an owner's switch is its own bundle**, emitted only when the
   switch is on; an island every article has stays in `post.js` (7.1 KB after the split).
   Each gated bundle carries its own copy of `dom` and `motion` (~1.5 KB) because an IIFE
   cannot share and a shared chunk would be a request every page pays.
3. **Heavy libs stay off the reader.** ProseMirror and `shiki` are admin-only or run
   server-side (Shiki highlights at save time into `render_cache` → zero client JS). Never
   import one from `src/assets/js/`. The Markdown engine is ours and has no
   dependencies at all since 2026-09-14 (ADR 0052), so the four parsers that used to be on
   this list are not installed any more.
4. **No third-party analytics/tag JS on the reader.** Built-in cookieless analytics only
   (`track.ts` → `/api/track`). (Edge injections — e.g. Cloudflare Web Analytics / Bot JS
   Detections — are a dashboard concern, not code, and are redundant here.)
5. **Scroll-reveal is pure CSS first.** `.reveal` cards ease in via `animation-timeline:
   view()` — zero JS on Chromium. The fallback in `core.js` covers ONLY browsers without
   scroll-timeline, behind the owner's scroll-fade switch and the motion gate. How anything
   moves, and the one switch that stops all of it, is the motion engine:
   [`conventions/motion.md`](conventions/motion.md).

## Navigation: prefetch every link, prerender on hover, zero runtime JS

Moved to [`navigation-speculation.md`](./navigation-speculation.md) on 2026-09-14: this file hit
its 400-line cap, and the journey between pages is a different subject from what one page loads.


## Verify (no browser needed)

- **Reader JS size:** `bun run build:assets` prints each bundle's bytes against its budget
  and exits non-zero when one is over. That is the check; there is nothing to diff by hand.
- **What a reader loads:** `bun run start`, fetch a post, extract `<script src>` + `<link
  rel=stylesheet>`; confirm `site.css` — **plus `pen-marks` / `pen-lines` if and only if the
  post carries a highlight or an underline** (ADR 0027) — `core.js` + `post.js`, plus
  `book-mode.js` / `comment-thread.js` / `reader-pen.js` if and only if that switch is on, and nothing else,
  and the correct font preloads for the site language.
- **Critical path / LCP:** Lighthouse "Network dependency tree" — the chain should be HTML →
  public CSS → (at most) the reading font's language subset(s). No chrome font, no unused
  subset, no admin CSS.
