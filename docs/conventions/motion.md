# Motion — one engine, one switch (HARD RULES)

Four files ARE the engine, and nothing about how the product moves lives anywhere else:

| Half | Reading site | Admin |
|---|---|---|
| CSS — tokens, floor, click, entrances, gates | `src/web/motion.css.ts` (`MOTION_TOKENS` and `MOTION_GATES` also bracket the sign-in sheet) | the foot of `src/admin/admin.css` |
| Script — the gate, the scroll loop, the cross-fade | `src/assets/js/motion.ts` | `src/admin/motion.ts` |

A component's own sheet says WHAT moves (which property, which state); the engine says HOW
(how long, on which curve, whether at all). A duration literal outside these files is drift,
and the audit that built the engine (2026-09-06) found eleven of them across four files at
four values for three intents.

- **Tokens: `--dur-fast` .15s · `--dur-base` .2s · `--dur-slow` .5s · `--ease-out`
  `cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.3,1)`.** Declared twice on purpose — the admin never receives the
  public sheet — and the two declarations must stay equal; no guard can see a drift between
  them, so a change to one is a change to both in the same commit. The captured
  `transition*` utilities in `src/admin/utilities.css` read `--dur-fast` through
  `--default-transition-duration`, so a `transition` in a `class` attribute and one in the
  sheet run at one speed — and `--default-transition-timing-function` now reads `--ease-out`
  for the same reason. ⚠ It did not until 2026-09-20, and that one line was most of the
  admin's motion: speeds matched while shapes did not. Three curves were doing one job — the
  reading site's floor on the keyword `ease`, the admin's on `cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)`
  (the framework's own), the token on a third value — and `utilities.css` declared a SECOND
  `--ease-out` at Tailwind's value, shadowed only by the concatenation order. All four say
  the one curve now. `--ease-out` is the one curve, introduced only once a real curve
  had been chosen (the rail's FLIP slide, then every entrance); the scroll-driven animations
  do NOT use it and must stay `linear` — a timeline a reader scrubs with a thumb is linear
  or it is wrong.
- ⚠️ **A scroll-driven animation may not declare a FILL** (`both`, `forwards`, `backwards`).
  Its value is written IN the frame, so where the frame is late — a long task, or a range an
  engine resolved once and never resolved again — the element goes on painting the fill.
  Measured 2026-09-20 by reading style after a scroll with no frame in between: with `both`,
  running text came back at opacity 0.35 and cards at opacity 0, a card with real height, real
  gaps around it and no words in it, held until something else moved the page. It had been
  reported three times over five weeks and patched three times at the geometry end. The fill
  buys nothing either way: a `view()` range is bounded by visibility at both ends, so its fill
  only ever describes the page in a state nobody can see, and a `scroll()` animation on the
  default range has no before or after phase to fill. `check:motion-drift` holds the rule with
  no exemption list, and `scripts/tour-flows-reading.ts` reproduces the late frame in a browser.
- **ONE switch gates ALL motion, on both sides.** `<html data-motion>` is server-rendered from
  `settings.motion.enabled` (no flash, no client JS) on the reading site, the sign-in page and
  the admin. `html[data-motion=off]` AND `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` each set
  `animation:none!important;transition:none!important` on every element and pseudo-element
  (`::backdrop` included) — instant, no branching. Don't add a second gate, and don't gate one
  rule at a time: the admin did, and every Tailwind `transition`, six skeleton pulses and the
  sidebar's width kept moving with the switch off. A STATE that must survive with motion off
  (the progress bar's static two-thirds) is a rule of its own under both gates; a duration
  never is. Toggle in Admin → Settings → Account → This admin.
- ⚠️ **The gates do NOT zero the tokens** (measured: `--dur-base` still reads .2s with the
  switch off). Script therefore never reads a token to decide whether to move: it asks
  `motionOn()` — the attribute and the media query — and `scrollBehavior()` for any
  programmatic scroll. Four admin call sites decided this for themselves before the engine
  (two read only the OS, two read nothing), so the switch stopped a hover and not a smooth
  scroll; the book's page turn held a BLANK spread for 130ms with the switch off, because its
  timer did not know the transition had gone. `glide()` is the replacement: a Web Animations
  move that reads `--dur-base` and `--ease-out` off the document and is an instant jump behind
  the gate. It took over from a cross-fade on 2026-09-14 — see the reading page for why a
  page turn slides rather than blinks.
- **One scroll loop.** Anything that watches the scroll goes through `onScrollFrame(read,
  write)`: one `requestAnimationFrame` shared by every island, every island's READ (rects,
  `scrollY`) before any island's WRITE (a class), so a scroll frame forces layout once rather
  than once per island. Four islands ran four loops on a post before this, and the second
  loop's reads landed after the first loop's writes on every frame.
- **The floor.** Every pressable thing (`:where(a,button,summary,input,select,textarea,
  [role=button])`) eases its colour, opacity and shadow at `--dur-fast`, at specificity zero, so
  a component's own `transition` wins outright and nothing snaps beside a neighbour that eases.
  ⚠ **The floor lists the things a FINGER uses**, so every span and div the island repaints
  falls outside it. Two of those carry a state rather than decoration and were changing by
  jumping: the pilot lamp (`LAMP_SHAPE` carries `transition-colors`) and a row that goes dead
  when the feature behind it has no engine (`[data-dim-when]`, one rule in `admin.css`). A new
  mark that reports a state needs one of the two, and neither is the floor's job.
  Only the properties a hover changes, never `all`: a transition on a layout property re-lays
  out on every frame, which is why the settings switch travels on a transform and the upload
  bars scale rather than widen.
- **THE CLICK is the one motion that is deliberately NOT symmetric.** A pressable control
  travels 1px and takes its carved shadow **instantly** — `active:translate-y-px
  active:duration-0` on `ui/Button`'s `SHAPE`, `transition-duration:0s` on the engine's list of
  the reading site's pressables — and only the RELEASE is sprung, on the inherited transition.
  A control that eases both ways feels like a screen; a key that drops now and springs back is
  what a hand expects of a pressed thing. Behind either gate the surface change stays and the
  travel goes — the state must still be legible without the movement, so relief is never the
  only cue.
- **The entrances.** A menu, a dialog, a toast, a slide-over ARRIVES rather than appears:
  `@starting-style` plus `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`, pure CSS, so `hidden = true`
  and `showModal()` stay the whole of the script. A dialog moves in OPACITY ONLY — a transform
  on it would make it the containing block for anything fixed inside it during the entrance,
  and the child would jump when the transform came off. An engine without `@starting-style`
  shows and hides instantly, which is the state every entrance rule starts from.
  ⚠ **The pen's bar and its note popup arrive too**, since 2026-09-20. They were the last two
  surfaces on the reading site that simply appeared — every other one that hides itself had an
  entrance — and the bar is the one a reader summons by hand, over their own selection. It
  RISES where the theme menu descends, because it is placed above what it belongs to. The
  blocks inside the popup (`.pen-ask`, `.pen-keep`) deliberately have none: a second entrance
  inside an entrance is two things moving where one moved.
- **Cheap properties only** (`opacity`/`transform`/`translate`/colour/shadow) so motion never
  causes layout or CLS. **Nothing may hide content it cannot reveal**: an entrance starts from
  the visible state where unsupported; `.reveal` is gated behind `@supports
  (animation-timeline)` + `data-motion=on` + the owner's scroll-fade switch, and it is the ONLY
  entrance a card has — a second `view()` animation on `.post-list > article` sat in
  `book.css.ts` outside that switch until the engine, so a feed with the fade off still rose on
  the way in. There is no page-nav cross-fade in 2.0: cross-document View Transitions were
  considered and not shipped ([`spec/04-frontend.md`](../spec/04-frontend.md)).
- `settings.motion.keys` is a scoped editor preference, not another motion engine. It enables
  the custom caret response and the synthesized key sound; its visual part asks `motionOn()`.
  Audio is generated locally, at the level `settings.motion.keyVolume` names, and must ignore
  IME composition, modifiers/navigation, paste and held-key repeats. ⚠️ Sound is NOT gated by
  the engine or by reduced motion: a person who asked for less movement did not ask for
  silence, and the two settings are not the same request. Nothing in that path may animate
  the text.
