# Looks — four dialects, one setting (`settings.look`)

The public site can be dressed in one of four dialects: **plain** (no sheet at all),
**code**, **paper** and **notes**. The admin calls the setting "Looks like" and never
"theme": a theme store would multiply the surface every guard and every tour flow has to
cover, and each dialect here has to earn its place by reaching a group of writers who would
otherwise not use this software. Four is the ceiling.

## What every dialect must obey

- **Its own sheet, linked only when it is worn** (`web/assets.ts`, `lookSheet`). `plain`
  links nothing, so a blog wearing no dialect is byte-for-byte what it was before looks
  existed. The source-code sheet used to ride inside `PUBLIC_CSS` and charged every blog on
  earth 20 KB for a look that was off by default.
- **One attribute selector, `html[data-look=<id>]`, on every rule.** Switching away leaves
  no trace: the attribute goes and the sheet stops being linked. Tested.
- **Colour from theme tokens only.** No hex, ever.
- **No words in `content:`.** A CSS content string cannot be translated. The one place a
  dialect needs language — the newspaper's `Fig.` and `Table` — rides in the per-page
  settings block from `locales/`, not in the cached sheet.
- **The admin never changes.** A look is what a reader sees. Support questions that begin
  "where is that button" must have one answer.

## Which dialect may touch the reading column

**`code` may touch the headlines and the code, and nothing else** (since 2026-09-23). Every
headline — the piece's title, a feed's titles, the front page's, the section heads inside a
piece — is set in the monospace, bold, and a highlighted code block carries line numbers. The
running text never: not the paragraphs, `.deck`, the excerpts or `.comment-body`. That look's
argument is still the contrast between a technical frame and an analogue text; the frame now
reaches the labels inside the column too, and a headline is a label. Tested per selector: one
that names a reading-column class must end on a heading or on a line of highlighted code.

**`paper` may**, and does: it numbers sections, numbers figures and tables, and moves the
byline under the headline. Its argument is that the whole page is a publication. What it
still never changes is the reading face, the measure, or the words.

⚠️ **The numbers are CSS, so they exist on the page and nowhere else**: not in the feed, not
in the newsletter, not in a search result, and not in what a reader copies. Prose that says
"as section 2.1 showed" is broken everywhere but the page it was written on.

**`notes` may**, for links (a highlighter band), for ragged-right setting (a hand does not
justify), and for nothing else. The paper pattern is on the SHEET, not behind paragraphs.

## code — the source-code dialect (HARD RULES)

The furniture around the article reads as source code; the reading column stays analogue.
The contrast is the point. Chosen in Admin → Settings → Appearance → Looks like, and
server-rendered as `<html data-look="code">` so the first paint is right and no island runs.

- **The monospace belongs to this look**, set on `body` and never on `--font-sans` (a blog
  whose reading font FOLLOWS the chrome font has `--font-reading: var(--font-sans)`, so
  moving that variable would set the article in monospace). Until 2026-09-13 the product's
  DEFAULT chrome font was JetBrains Mono, which meant an untouched blog already read as
  technical and left this dialect with almost nothing to say; the default is Inter now.
- **No filled surfaces, and since 2026-09-14 no bars either.** A tinted sidebar was drawn and
  rejected, then tinted bars top and foot, rejected too: this dialect dresses the chrome, and
  a filled panel turns furniture into a second surface arguing with the words. What was left
  was two full-width hairlines, one under the header and one over the footer — and those are
  gone as well. With them went the full-bleed `margin-inline`/`padding-inline` that stretched
  them and the `overflow-x: clip` on the root that stopped the stretch growing a scrollbar:
  three rules that existed only to carry a line nobody wanted. The footer takes the 3rem the
  rest of the product gives it; it was `.6rem` here, which left the copyright line nine
  pixels off the bottom of the page.

- **It never touches the running text** — not the paragraphs, `.deck`, the excerpts or
  `.comment-body`. Headlines and code blocks are the exception above. Tested.
- **Line numbers are a counter on `pre.shiki .line`**, with `user-select:none`, so neither a
  drag-select nor the copy button takes them. A plain (unhighlighted) block has no lines to
  count and gets none. The empty line Shiki closes a block with gets no number.
- **Two syntax roles, both from theme tokens.** An editor distinguishes a comment from a
  literal, so: labels are `--c-meta` and carry a `//` marker from CSS (never markup, so the
  heading a feed and a screen reader see stays the plain word); counts, dates and figures
  are `--c-text` and counts are bracketed. Never `--c-accent`: this blog's accent is red,
  so every date read as a link that was not one. No third colour, no hex. Tested.
- **Every chrome label is marked, not just the rail's** — the tagline, the series head,
  the related list, the sign-up card, the comment thread, an empty state. One selector
  list, so a new chrome heading that is missed is visibly missed. Tested.
- **`[n]` means literal; `/` means path.** Both come from the SHEET, never from a renderer
  — the round parentheses in the base sheet too, or the switch could not put them back.
  Dates, figures, indices, counts and the pager are all bracketed, and **the brackets are
  `--c-meta` while their contents are `--c-text`**: they are punctuation, not the value.
  The feed's gutter year takes the slash because a year over its months is a hierarchy.
  Markup supplies only the wrappers CSS cannot invent: `.num` round a figure, `.term-list`
  round a run of terms. Tested both ends. (The rail's counts were a filled ring for one
  deploy, on the argument that a term cloud has no sequence to punctuate. Rejected.)
- **The rail keeps the alignment it has with the switch off:** ranged right, hugging the
  article, so the toggle moves nothing but the gutter. The line numbers are rings sitting ON the
  rail's divider out past the text, so they cost the rail no width. An earlier pass ranged
  the rail left to put a gutter column where an editor puts it, and it was rejected.
  **The ring is CENTRED on that divider**: the line is 1px at 13px past the rail's edge, so
  its middle is 12.5 and an 18px ring centred there ends at 21.5. It ended at 23 until
  2026-09-12, which left the hairline meeting every ring 1.5px off its diameter.
  **A sub-heading's number is a pill that sizes itself**, centred by putting its left edge on
  12.5 and shifting it half its own width — so the arithmetic holds whatever the number is.
  It was a fixed 30px, which clipped the last digit off every number from `2.10` on and was
  1.8px too narrow for `2.1` as well; the rail's overhang is 56px so nothing there is cut.
- **In the band (60rem to the rail breakpoint) there is no gutter, so there are no line
  numbers on the menu.** A ring there lands INSIDE the 24px between two menu words, three
  pixels from each, and the row reads as one run-on string. The index keeps its numbers,
  because there each entry is a line of its own and the number falls at the end of it. The
  band's own invented heading — the menu has none in the markup and takes one from its
  `aria-label` — carries the comment marker like any other chrome heading; it cannot get it
  from this sheet (it is not an `h2`, and its `::before` is already the label), so
  `render/rail-css.ts` restates it and `render/rail-css.test.ts` holds it.
- **The gutter is legible** (`--c-meta`, 4.56:1), not a hairline. `--c-rule` measured
  1.16:1 against the page, and a generated counter is still announced by some screen
  readers. What makes a gutter a gutter is where it sits and that its figures are tabular.

## code — the header and the index (HARD RULES)

- **The header controls swap icons for tokens, from 640px up**: `[/tìm] [tối] [lưới]
  [@email]`. BOTH are in the markup and the sheet decides which has a box, because the
  switch must leave no trace when it is off — a reader who does not want the terminal look
  gets the icons the site has always had. Below 640px the icons stay: five words are far
  wider than five 40px squares and would wrap the header.
- **A sub-heading in the index is a PATH SEGMENT, not a smaller line.** Same size and weight
  as its parent with a leading `/`, and numbered WITHIN it (`2.1`), because a flat 1..12 run
  made a sub-heading of section 2 look like section 7. Use **`counter-set`, never
  `counter-reset`**: a reset on the parent row creates a new instance scoped to that row and
  its siblings, and the children go on reading the outer one — measured, the index ran
  `1.1 1.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 3.6`. With the switch off the index keeps its bullet and smaller size.

## A LOOK CONTAINS NO COLOUR

Settled 2026-09-13, after two releases the other way. A look sets shape, type and marks;
what colour they come out in is the **palette's**, always — the owner's default, or whatever
the reader has picked from the menu. `looks.test.ts` fails on a hex anywhere in a look
sheet, and there is no exemption.

The argument for the other way was that a newspaper and a notebook are *materials*: ink on
newsprint, cream paper and a blue rule, not decisions a blog makes. What it cost was the
palette menu. `html[data-look=paper]` is (0,1,1) and `[data-palette=mono]` is (0,1,0), so on
those two looks choosing Mono, Sepia or Forest changed **not one pixel** — four of six rows
were dead controls, and nothing said so. A control that lies is worse than a green
newspaper.

What a look may still derive: anything computed **from** the tokens. The notebook's desk is
`oklch(from var(--c-bg) …)`, so it follows the reader wherever they take the palette.

## notes — the notebook dialect, in brief

A sheet of dot-grid paper lying on a desk, written on by hand. Every colour in it is the
palette's.

- **Dot grid, on the sheet, since 2026-09-23.** It replaced a rule drawn under every line of
  every paragraph. That ruling could not drift, and it read as a form: every excerpt on the
  front page underlined line by line, a rule between a date and its headline. Dots give text
  no line to sit on or miss, so nothing drifts and nothing has to be drawn per paragraph.
- **Links are marked with a highlighter** — a band of the accent thinned into the page over
  the lower half of the words, replacing the drawn underline (reset size, position and repeat,
  or the band is cut into the underline's tiles). In Mono the accent is near-black, so the
  band is grey; every other palette colours it.
- **Ragged right, whatever the book-typography switch says.**
- **The quiet ink is stepped down through a SECOND NAME** (`--c-meta-desk` on the root, handed
  to the body as `--c-meta`). It was `--c-meta` mixed from `var(--c-meta)` on the body, which
  is a cycle: the property went invalid and every quiet line fell back to the full text ink
  from 2026-09-14 to 09-23, hiding the hand-drawn series box and the section ticks with it.

- **The desk is the page's own lightness taken down**, one formula for both halves of the
  day (`oklch(from var(--c-bg) calc(l * …) c h)`, behind `@supports`) — and derived, so it
  follows the palette. It used to be the ink mixed into the paper, and at night the ink is
  the pale one, so the desk rose ABOVE the page and the sheet read as a hole cut in the
  board. A custom property swallows a value it cannot use and fails only when something
  reads it, hence the `@supports` and the `color-mix` left standing as the fallback.
- **The sheet goes under all THREE layouts.** `main > article` is the piece, `.post-list` is
  a feed, and `div.front` is the composed front — the one most visitors land on, and the one
  that had no paper under it at all.
- **No second face, and that is a decision rather than an omission.** The newspaper earns
  one because a paper really does cut its headlines from a second serif. A FACE is not a
  colour: the rule above forbids the second, not the first. The face that would
  say "notebook" is a handwriting face, and the ones within reach carry no Vietnamese: on a
  blog in this product's own first language that is a system fallback on every accented
  word. The name on the cover takes the reading face instead, which is the closest thing
  here to the owner's own hand.
- **A heading is underlined to the width of its WORDS** (`width: fit-content`), in ink. A
  rule that runs the column is a border; a hand stops where the writing stops.

## paper — the newspaper dialect

A masthead, a lead headline, column rules, and a piece printed as an offprint.

- **The menu is in the masthead on every page** (`menuInHeader` in `article.ts` and
  `listing-page.ts` when the look is `paper`), and the rail's copy is hidden. On a phone it is
  one strip that scrolls sideways, painted here because the base paints it only above 60rem.
  Inline on a piece it had been a block headed MENU between the series box and the contents,
  and the first line of text sat at y=980 on a 1000px screen; it is at 832 now.
- **The contents are one run of numbered sections**, not a column of rows, and the piece's
  own title is dropped from them.
- **The series box stays where the markup puts it**, above the text, as one head band and one
  run of numbered parts. It was moved to the foot with a flex column and `order` for one
  build: drawn at y=4050, read by Tab and a screen reader straight after the byline. A visual
  order that is not the reading order fails WCAG 1.3.2 and 2.4.3; moving it is a markup
  decision, never a sheet's.
- **A shelf with nothing left on it is hidden** — a page, or a piece with its contents off,
  whose rail held only the menu.
- **The first letter is a drop cap**, `initial-letter:3` only, with no float fallback. Three
front-page shapes are dressed, not one: `list`, `grid` (the reader's own toggle) and the
composed `front`.

- **`display:contents` on `.site-bar`** is what lets the masthead interleave the strapline
  with the name and the section menu: those three are inside the bar and the strapline is
  its sibling, so no alignment inside the bar can put one between the others. Dropping the
  bar's box promotes its children into the header itself. The name then needs
  `margin-inline: 0`, because in the bar's own row it carries `margin-right: auto` to push
  the controls right — with the bar's box gone that auto margin ate 917px and pinned the
  name to the left edge under a centred strapline.
- **The header is a GRID of `1fr auto 1fr`, and the controls end the strapline's row.**
  They were absolute at the top right, which on a masthead centred everywhere else left
  them in a corner with nothing opposite and, on an article, alone over 90px of white. A
  column flex cannot pair two children on one line, which is why it is a grid; the outer
  columns stay equal whatever the controls measure, so the strapline keeps the name's axis.
  Place the name as `:is(.title,.site-h1)` — it is a bare anchor on most pages and an `h1`
  wrapping that anchor on a listing whose lead card is off.
- **Under 44rem the controls take their own row, centred**, and give up the `-.625rem`
  optical pull: that exists to line the last glyph up with the rule at the column edge, and
  centred there is no edge to line up with.
- **Never set a FLAT `display` on `.site-menu` here.** The base sheet hides it under 60rem
  and paints its links only above that width, so a flat `display:flex` once outranked the
  hide and put five default-blue underlined links across a phone masthead, beside a drawer
  button that opened the same five. The phone strip now lives in its own narrow-width block
  that paints the links, and the drawer no longer carries the menu.
- **One gutter for every column rule on the page** (`margin-left:-20px;padding-left:20px`
  against a 40px gap), centred IN the gap and never drawn at a card's edge. The card grid
  ships 28px of its own, so this look restates it: the same hairline standing 14px off a
  picture in one place and 20px off words in another reads as a mistake.
- **The section goes over the headline, the date and the byline under it.** That is what a
  paper does, and the web habit of stacking all of it above the title opens the page on
  housekeeping. The two halves are one paragraph in the markup, so the paragraph gives up
  its box with `display: contents` and the header grid then places the section, the
  headline, the standfirst and the facts by hand. The middot between the two halves comes
  from the base sheet (`.post-cat::after`), which is what lets this look drop it; the ONE
  space stays in the markup, or `textContent` reads "TypographySeptember".
- **The series box is a standing box, and nothing here draws a corner radius.** A heavy rule
  over it, the head as small letterspaced capitals on a band of its own, a hairline, then
  the parts. The marker beside the part being read is the margin's change bar in heading
  ink: it was the accent, and in this look the accent is the link blue, so a blue bar beside
  black type said the line was a link.
- **An all-caps label in a ruled band takes `line-height: 1`.** A line box reserves room
  for a descender and for an ascender above the cap, and a caps label uses neither, so at
  inherited leading it sat 2px high between its own rules. This face closes that by itself:
  Inter's ascender less its cap height (0.2413em) is its descender (0.2412em), so at
  leading 1 equal padding centres the ink. Measured: 9px over the cap, 9px under the
  baseline.
- **In grid mode each card takes a rule across its HEAD, not down its side.** A column rule
  does not survive a wrapping grid: the column count changes with the width, and the feed
  wraps each year's entries in their own block, so `nth-child` counts the year marker as the
  first child and the rule landed left of cards already in the first column.
- **The shelf moves inline on a PIECE only.** On a listing it is the navigation: moved
  inline there it landed at y=8167, under thirty-three posts. The hook is structural — on a
  piece the rail sits inside the `<article>`, on a listing it is a sibling of the feed — and
  deliberately not a class, because the first hook tried was the book-typography class,
  which is a SETTING the owner can turn off.

## notes — the notebook dialect

A dot-grid page lying on a plain desk.

- **The sheet is `main > article`, never `article`.** A listing's rows are `<article>`
  elements too, and the bare selector drew a bordered card round every entry on the front
  page.
- **One inset on all four sides, and the sheet grows OUTWARD by exactly what it pads**, so
  the first line of the piece stays on the line the shelf and the card start on and not one
  word of the column moves when the dialect is switched. 20px, plus one for the border on
  the top margin. Below 46rem it drops to 12: the only side space there is the page's own
  25px of padding, and a 20px sheet left four pixels of desk showing, which is a near miss
  rather than a margin.
- **History: the ruling was drawn per paragraph** (2026-09-14 to 09-23), because one ruled
  background across the sheet drifts against pictures and cuts through text. It was replaced
  by the dot grid, which has no line to drift.
- **The desk is a tone darker than the page.** The dots are on the sheet, not the desk: what
  makes a sheet look like a sheet is that the thing under it is not the same colour. Both hairlines in the gutter go with it, and the two dots that hung on them.
- **No arrow on an outbound link.** U+2197 is outside both bundled subsets and fell back to
  a system face; drawn instead as a rotated U+2191 it was its own inline box and broke onto
  the next line by itself at 390px.
