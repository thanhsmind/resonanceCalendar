# Docker, instead of systemd

> A complete alternative to the native install in [`self-host.md`](self-host.md), not a step
> inside it. Read when touching the image, the compose files or `deploy/`.

The native guide's sections **1, 2, 4 and 9** are replaced by what follows. Still yours to
do from [`self-host.md`](self-host.md): **nginx** (section 5), **your account** (section 6 —
a link the log prints, not a shell command), **the CDN note** (section 7), **the cron ticks**
(section 8), and taking a backup before an upgrade.

**Give the container 256 MB; 192 MB is the floor.** Measured on a real blog with pictures,
serving costs 56 MB and a quarter of a CPU is enough. What needs the rest is encoding the
smaller copies of an upload, which runs on the tick two minutes after boot: `--memory=128m` and
`160m` are killed there, and at `192m` it runs but an encode may be killed and retried on the
next tick. Two things make that fit — the image runs `bun --smol`, because JavaScriptCore sizes
its heap from the HOST's memory and cannot see a cgroup limit, and each variant is encoded in a
child process ([ADR 0061](decisions/0061-the-image-codec-runs-in-a-child-process.md)), so a
killed encoder no longer takes the blog with it ([delivery](delivery.md#the-budget)).

There are two ways in. **Pull the published image** if you just want it running — nothing to
clone, no Bun on the host, no build step, and `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` both exist:

```bash
docker run -d --name quire -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -e SITE_URL=https://example.com \
  -v quire-data:/var/lib/quire/data -v quire-uploads:/var/lib/quire/uploads \
  quireink/quireink:latest
docker logs quire            # prints the link that claims the blog
```

**That second line is the account step**, and it is a log read rather than a shell: a blog
nobody owns prints a one-time `/setup` link every time it starts, so a NAS with a log panel
and no TTY can finish the install in a browser. A panel with no log at all? Set
`SETUP_CODE` (twelve characters or more) as an environment variable and `/setup` asks for it
instead of the link. Section 6 of [`self-host.md`](self-host.md#6-your-account) has the whole
of it, the CLI included.

Two registries carry it and they are the same bytes: `quireink/quireink` on Docker Hub,
which is what a NAS search box looks in, and `ghcr.io/joiha-steven/quireink`. One workflow
run builds once and copies the finished manifest to the second, so a version number cannot
mean two different images.

`:latest` is the tag to install and the one the documentation now uses everywhere: the
newest release is the one with the fixes in it, and a blog left on an old tag is a blog left
with the bugs that release fixed. Nothing moves under a running container either way, because
Docker only changes the image when you pull. The two-part tag (`:2.2`) still takes fixes
within a line for anyone who wants to step up a major version deliberately, and the
three-part one (`:2.2.0`) pins one exact release forever.

**Or take HTTPS with it.** [`docker-compose.caddy.yml`](../docker-compose.caddy.yml) is the
same service with Caddy in front, which gets a certificate from Let's Encrypt and renews it
by itself: no certbot, nothing scheduled, and section 5's nginx block is not needed at all.
Point the domain at the machine first, then:

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env       # set SITE_URL, uncomment COMPOSE_FILE
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs quire         # the link that claims the blog
```

No `-f` in those: uncommenting `COMPOSE_FILE` in `.env` is what selects this file, and it
keeps selecting it for every later command. The flag would have to be repeated on all of
them, and the one it gets forgotten on is the upgrade months later — which rebuilds the
plain file instead, brings the blog back on loopback with no certificate, and says nothing.

There is no domain to write twice. Caddy takes the certificate's name straight out of
`SITE_URL`.

The [`Caddyfile`](../Caddyfile) beside it carries the same security headers the nginx block
does, including the content security policy the app is tested against. Use the plain compose
file instead when something else already terminates TLS — an existing nginx, a tunnel, a
load balancer — because two of them fighting over ports 80 and 443 is a worse problem than
the one this solves.

**Or take HTTPS WITHOUT a checkout.** The compose above and the Caddy one both say `build: .`,
so both want the source. [`docker-compose.image.yml`](../docker-compose.image.yml) is the
Caddy arrangement over the published image. Two files, because the `Caddyfile` is the same one
the checkout uses and a second copy of a tested CSP would drift:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joiha-steven/quireink/main/docker-compose.image.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joiha-steven/quireink/main/Caddyfile
printf 'SITE_URL=https://example.com\n' > .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.image.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.image.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.image.yml logs quire
```

**That `pull` is not decoration.** `up` uses whatever image is already on the machine and says
nothing about its age: on a box that had pulled once before, `latest` started a blog two
releases behind the tag it named, printed a claim link, and looked entirely correct. It was
found by reading the version in its own log. Upgrading is `pull` then `up -d`.

**Or build it yourself** from this repository, which is what `docker-compose.yml` does and
what you want if you have changed anything:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joiha-steven/quireink.git && cd quireink
cp .env.docker.example .env          # set SITE_URL, and that is the whole of it
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs quire            # the claim link, same as above
```

The image builds from source and runs `bun --smol src/index.ts`, which is what the server in section 4
runs too. It is deliberately NOT the compiled binary: `bun build --compile` does not bundle
sharp's native module, so a compiled image has to keep a binary and a native addon agreed
about libc across every base bump, and this way `bun install` resolves sharp for the
platform like any other package.

Four things worth knowing before you change anything in `docker-compose.yml`:

- **The port is published on `127.0.0.1` on purpose.** Docker writes its own iptables rules,
  so a plain `3000:3000` reaches the internet even when the host firewall says otherwise.
- **`DATA_DIR` and `STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR` are set by compose**, after `.env` and therefore
  winning over it. They are where the volumes are mounted; a `.env` that redefines them
  points the app at an unmounted directory, where the database it writes disappears with the
  container.
- **The volumes are named volumes by default, and bind mounts work too.** A fresh named
  volume inherits the image's ownership. A bind mount keeps the HOST's ownership, so since
  2026-08-21 the image starts as root, adopts `PUID`/`PGID` (1000:1000 by default), chowns
  the two directories only when the ownership is actually wrong, and drops to that user
  before the app starts. `docker run --user 1000:1000` skips all of it.
- **Upgrades are `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.** The schema is applied at boot
  as usual. Your content is in the volumes and is not touched by a rebuild. Since ADR 0063 a
  pending migration empties the two rebuildable render caches, then writes a copy of the
  database into `data/backups/` before it runs anything — named for the step it is about to
  apply — and **if that copy cannot be written the container exits instead of migrating**,
  saying which path and why. Two are kept.

To get data out without a bind mount, use the backup button in the admin (it hands you both
databases plus every upload), or `docker compose cp quire:/var/lib/quire/data ./data`.

## On a NAS or a home server

**Two things a NAS install has to get right, and neither reports itself.** The box already
has a reverse proxy with its own certificate UI, so use it: sign-in cannot complete over
plain HTTP at a LAN address, because the session cookie is `__Host-` and a browser keeps
that only on a secure connection. The password and the code are both accepted and the
cookie is dropped, over and over. The login screen says so when it happens. And set `CSP`
in the container's environment to the policy in
[`docs/self-host.md`](./self-host.md) section 07: the NAS proxy sends no
Content-Security-Policy of its own, and the app sends none unless asked.


Every box below runs the same published image and none of them needs a shell. What they
share is one trap, so it comes first.

Their container UIs mount real folders rather than named volumes, because that is what their
own backup jobs can see. Point both mounts at a folder you created, and set the UID and GID
that own it — on a Synology, look under Control Panel → User & Group; 1026 and 100 are
typical for the first non-admin user:

```yaml
    environment:
      PUID: 1026
      PGID: 100
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/quireink/data:/var/lib/quire/data
      - /volume1/docker/quireink/uploads:/var/lib/quire/uploads
```

Nothing else changes. The first boot prints one `entrypoint: adopting …` line per directory
and later boots print none, because the check is one `stat` and the walk only happens when
the answer is wrong — a re-chown of a large uploads tree on every restart would turn a
restart into an outage.

### Unraid

**Apps → search `QuireInk`.** The template is in Community Applications, so the image, the
icon, the WebUI link and both paths arrive filled in; what you set is where the two paths
point and, if you are reaching the blog from outside, `SITE_URL`.

### Synology (DSM 7.2 and later)

Container Manager is Synology's own Docker, and it reads a compose file directly, so there
is nothing here that is Synology-shaped.

1. In **File Station**, make the folder the blog will live in — say
   `docker/quireink`, with `data` and `uploads` inside it.
2. In **Container Manager → Project**, create a project, point it at that folder, and choose
   to write a `docker-compose.yml`. Paste the compose from the top of this file, with the
   two bind mounts and the `PUID`/`PGID` above.
3. Build it, then open the project's **log**. The claim link is in there — that is the
   account step, and it is why this install needs no terminal.
4. To reach it from outside, put it behind **Control Panel → Login Portal → Advanced →
   Reverse Proxy** and set `SITE_URL` to the address you gave it. Feeds, the sitemap, share
   images and newsletter links are all built from that one value.

Older DSM has **Docker** rather than Container Manager, and no compose UI; use the
`docker run` at the top of this file over SSH instead.

### QNAP

**Container Station → Applications → Create**, and paste the same compose. The mount and
`PUID`/`PGID` advice above applies unchanged; QNAP's first non-admin user is usually
`1000:100`, which you can confirm under Control Panel → Privilege.

### Runtipi

Runtipi's official app store [stopped accepting new
applications](https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/issues/2317), so there is no Quire Ink
entry to search for and there is not going to be one. Use **Add custom app** and give it the
compose above — the result is the same container, managed by Runtipi like any other app.

## Kubernetes

Same image, four manifests, `kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes`:
[`deploy/kubernetes/README.md`](../deploy/kubernetes/README.md).

Read the first section of that page before you scale anything: the workload is a
**StatefulSet with one replica**, and that is a correctness requirement rather than a starting
point, because a second pod on the same SQLite volume is a corrupted blog that nothing warns
you about.
