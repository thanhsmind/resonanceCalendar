# The editor's own contract

The rules that are true of the WRITING SURFACE and of nothing else in the admin; the rest of
the admin is [`admin-design.md`](./admin-design.md). Read when touching the editor.

The seam is real rather than arithmetic. Every other screen in this admin is a form or a
list, and the visual contract next door is written for those: cards, gaps, one setting, one
of each. The editor is the one place that carries a second typeface (it is WYSIWYG, so it
must write in the face it publishes in), a caret this product draws itself, and a sound. Read
that file first; this one only adds what is true here.

## The editor

- The chrome is the SHEET'S OWN top rows (the Writing Desk mock's `sheettop`): the action
  line — back link + save state + word count on the left, quiet Markdown/Attributes text
  controls and the Preview/View/Save/Publish buttons on the right — is the card's first row, and
  the toolbar sticks directly under it. One piece: a floating band over a crack of page
  between it and the paper was rejected as looking off (2026-08-17). Never shadowed.
  The global sidebar shows again since the two-pane write screen; the write pane (the list
  column) sits beside the sheet from 1640px up, pinned at the same top as the sheet's chrome.
- **Reading the piece is a button on that row, beside Preview** (2026-09-11) — for a post that
  is published, saved and past its date; a note points at `/notes/<slug>`. It lived only in the
  attributes sheet's header before, so looking at your own published post cost opening a panel
  first. It is not in both places: the sheet keeps History and Analytics. On a phone it joins
  Preview inside the row's "⋯". ⚠️ **Measured 2026-09-11:** with it the action line wraps to two
  rows above `lg` in the long-label locales (Russian at 1920: 56px → 100px). Vietnamese and
  English stay on one row at 1640, which is where the write pane arrives beside the sheet.
- The title lives ON the sheet (`screens/sheet.ts`), in the reading face, with the meta line
  (status · last touched) under it. It aligns with the public reading column, wraps
  naturally, and uses content-driven height so a long one is never clipped.
- **The toolbar is BACK, by the owner's verdict after writing on the bare version**
  (2026-08-17 — "/" alone is fine in the Markdown view, but the normal view wants a
  toolbar, reversing ADR 0024 step 4's removal, which the mock had endorsed). It sits at the top of the sheet under the
  action line, full-width, its groups centered, wrapping on a narrow window rather than
  scrolling — and when it wraps its lines range LEFT, on the same edge the action line
  starts from, rather than each line centring itself. The Markdown source view has NO
  toolbar — raw text needs no formatting buttons. The called controls remain beside it: a
  selection raises the bubble, `/` on an empty line raises the insert menu (which prints
  each block's Markdown shortcut beside its row). The closing line under the writing says
  the two gestures once.
- **The table's tools get their own line**, under the strip and ranged left, and only while
  the cursor is in a table. They used to join the end of the main run, and because that run
  is centred, five buttons arriving slid every button already there 62.5px to the left
  (measured at 1440, 2026-09-12) and taking the cursor out slid them back. A toolbar that
  moves while it is being aimed at is not a toolbar. Clusters are told apart by a 12px gap
  rather than a hairline for the same reason: a rule can end up the first mark on a wrapped
  line, and a stray tick at the start of a row reads as damage.
- **Find and replace is DRAWN, never applied** (2026-09-13). `Mod-f` raises a strip under the
  action line with the find field alone; `Mod-Shift-f` raises the same strip with the replace
  field open, and a chevron at its head opens that field for a hand that came in through the
  first chord. TWO CHORDS because most of the time it is find: a replace box that is always
  there is a box that is usually in the way, and a second empty field under the cursor while
  somebody is only reading is an invitation to type into the wrong one. The strip sits in the
  sheet's own sticky stack rather than floating over the paper, and pushes the toolbar down
  while it is open. In the writing surface the hits are ProseMirror
  DECORATIONS (`FindExtension.ts`) and in the Markdown view they are `<mark>` in the mirror
  (`MarkdownSource.withHits`) — in both cases beside the text rather than on it, which is the
  only shape the contract below allows: a mark would go into the undo history, into the
  Markdown the piece saves as, and out to the reader. Matching is plain text and never a
  regular expression (`editorFind.ts` says why), non-overlapping so stepping agrees with what
  Replace all will do, and case-insensitive unless the `Aa` switch says otherwise. Replace all
  is ONE transaction, walked backwards so no position needs mapping, so one undo puts it all
  back. ⚠️ The strip SELECTS each hit as it steps onto it, so the formatting bubble is
  suppressed while it is open — without that it rose over every match and covered the line
  above the word the writer had gone looking for.
  ⚠️ `Mod-f` is taken from the browser, the only chord here that is. Same trade as `Mod-s`:
  the browser's find cannot search the Markdown view's textarea usefully, cannot replace, and
  matches the rail and the write pane as readily as the piece.
- **A SAVE MAY NOT CHANGE THE READER'S PAGE.** This is the editor's one hard contract and it
  was unwritten until 2026-08-30, when it turned out to be broken: 19 of the 45 fixtures in
  `golden/corpus` published differently after one pass through the writing surface. Footnote
  references and callout tags were escaped into `\[^1\]` and `\[!NOTE\]` — which the maths
  extension then claimed, so the reader got an empty formula mid-sentence rather than even the
  literal text. Table column alignment was dropped. Consecutive pictures lost the blank line
  between them and landed inside one `<p>`. `md/to-markdown-escape.ts` and `md/from-editor.ts` hold the
  repairs; `editor-corpus.test.ts` holds the contract, by rendering every fixture before and
  after and comparing the HTML.
  ⚠️ **A fixed point is not the contract.** That file's original law — serialize twice, compare
  — passed on all four of those, because a document that is destroyed once and then holds still
  IS a fixed point. Anything that asks "does it settle?" is blind to "did it lose something?".
  ⚠️ **Nor is "it still renders".** Eight fixtures are allowed to move, because Markdown itself
  permits the normalisation — entities decode, a lazy line folds, a reference link is written
  back inline. Excusing them by asserting only that the output is non-empty made the hatch
  wider than the law: any of the eight could have collapsed to one character and the check
  would have said ok. Each now carries a BEHAVIOUR it belongs to, both counts are bounded, and
  what it publishes after a save is pinned in `golden/editor/` and compared byte for byte —
  the same shape `src/render/golden.test.ts` uses for its divergences from 1.x.
- **Keyboard: one table, in `admin-shared/keys.ts`**, read by the handlers AND by the Help screen, so a
  chord cannot move without the printed sheet following it. The editor's own table is
  [`editor/keymap.ts`](../src/admin/editor/keymap.ts) — every chord it answers, in one place,
  where twenty-one extensions each declared their own until ADR 0054's step 7. What this product
  adds on top is `Mod-s` (save), `Mod-k` (link), `Mod-f` (find),
  `Mod-Shift-f` (find and replace), `Mod-Shift-h` (highlighter), `Mod-Shift-o` (ring), `Mod-Shift-x` (strip marks),
  `Mod-Shift-a` (Attributes), `Mod-Shift-m` (Markdown source) and `Mod-\` (focus).
  ⚠️ **`Mod-s` is not a convenience.** Autosave here writes to localStorage and NEVER to the
  server — deliberately, so editing a published post cannot push half a sentence live. Before
  this chord existed, a writer pressing Cmd+S got the browser's own "Save page as…" dialog and
  a reasonable belief that the work was safe. Collisions were checked against the live keymap
  and against the browsers; `Mod-Shift-i` and `Mod-Shift-p` were dropped for belonging to
  DevTools and to a Firefox private window.
- **The autosave is TWO copies and neither of them is the published body.** localStorage on
  this device (since M2) and `posts.autosave_json` on the server (2026-08-30), written on the
  same timer and on the same flushes — interval, `pagehide`, `visibilitychange` to hidden, and
  leaving the screen — with the middle two going by `sendBeacon`, because a `fetch` started as
  the tab goes away is routinely killed mid-flight. The interval is a setting
  (`autosaveSeconds`, 120 by default, floored at 15), and the flushes are why widening it is
  safe: none of them may be dropped to "simplify" this. Only Save/Publish moves `content`, so
  editing a live post still cannot push half a sentence to a reader.
  ⚠️ **Uniform for drafts and published posts**, and that is the decision rather than the
  shortcut. "A draft is not live, so autosave straight into its row" is a RACE: it can be
  published a second later and the status the write read is already stale.
  The editor offers back whichever copy is newer, and says which — the device's almost always,
  the server's in the one case the device cannot help with. A piece that has never been saved
  has no row to hang a snapshot on, so localStorage stays its only copy until the first save,
  and on the way back in it is REOPENED into the editor rather than offered above an empty
  page: it is the only copy there is, so there is nothing for it to be restored over.
  ⚠️ **The key follows the PIECE, not the screen** — `quire:draft:post:new` until the piece has
  a row, then its own slug. Fixed at the value it had when the editor mounted (until
  2026-09-07), everything typed after a new post's first save went on being written under
  `new`, where the editor that reopens that post never looks and the next blank sheet reopens
  it as a piece of its own.
- The attributes are a right-hand sheet (`screens/sheet-panel.ts`, opened by
  `island/lib/sheet-open.ts`). The first Publish on an unpublished
  piece opens it as the PUBLISH sheet, footered "Later / Publish", and that one always lies
  on top of the page over a scrim: those are questions being answered about the piece, and
  a column that squeezed the writing to make room for them is what ADR 0024 step 5 ended.
- **A sheet the writer opens themselves DOCKS from 85rem up** (`DOCK_AT` in
  `island/lib/sheet-open.ts`). On
  top of the page it hid 232px of the writing column at 1280 (34.5% of every line), 104px at
  1440 and 200px at 1920 — while 348px of paper stood empty beside the text at that last
  width (measured 2026-09-12). Above 85rem the canvas holds its right edge clear, the column
  keeps its measure and re-centres in what is left, and the sheet drops its scrim and its
  `aria-modal` because the page behind it has not gone anywhere. Below that width there is not
  enough room for both and it goes back on top. (672px exactly at 1440; 666 at 1700 with the
  write pane beside the editor as well, which is the only place the sheet costs the column
  anything at all.)
- The editor frame must NOT use `overflow-hidden` — it breaks the nested sticky bars. The
  table bar's sticky offset is measured from the real action-header height, so it does not
  drift with the viewport or the translation.
- The prose `contenteditable` must not inherit the global focus outline; the surrounding card
  is the boundary. Focus rings stay on discrete controls.
- **Key feedback is a CHOICE OF INSTRUMENT, not a switch** (2026-08-24): `woody`, `crisp`,
  `deep`, `off`. It defaults to `woody`, is stored as `motion.keys`, and older spellings are
  migrated on read.
  ⚠️ **The names are not the names of real machines, on purpose.** The synthesis is modelled
  on those three mechanisms and says so at length in `key-voices.ts`, but they do not sound
  close enough to the real machines to borrow their names. A label promising an Underwood and delivering a good synthesised
  knock makes the sound worse by comparison. They are named for what they are. The click is generated locally: no audio files anywhere, ever.
  ⚠️ **The three are three MACHINES, not three filter settings.** A strike is a SEQUENCE OF
  EVENTS, written as physics in `key-voices.ts`:
  **woody** runs a lever, throws a typebar at the platen through a ribbon, and lets
  the carriage step — three events over 60ms, a low wooden thump with an inharmonic metal
  ring on it, and a bright escapement tick after; the **space bar** strikes nothing at all
  and **return** throws the carriage all the way back;
  **crisp** snaps a leaf and then bottoms out 14ms later, bright and gone in 40ms;
  **deep** has no bump, a blunted onset, and a quiet upstroke 62ms later.
  Measured, and held there by `key-render.test.ts`: brightness (energy above 2 kHz) is
  0.37 / 0.08 / 0.00, and the spectral centre is 2236 / 460 / 226 Hz. Every fundamental sits
  above 200 Hz **because of the speaker, not the ear** — a laptop is down hard by then, and a
  thock drawn at 150 Hz measures beautifully and is inaudible on the machine it is for.
  Four keys, three takes of each (level-matched to the first, so takes differ in grain and
  not in force), plus a few percent of playback rate: forty keys in a line never repeat.
  Selection-safe, IME-safe, and skipped entirely during composition.
  ⚠️ **Nothing animates the TEXT.** Until 2026-08-24 every keystroke animated the whole
  block's opacity from 0.9 and nudged it 0.6px, which at sixty words a minute is a paragraph
  strobing five times a second — reported as "nháy". The sound carries the keystroke, the
  caret carries the position, and the words hold still. Do not put a pulse back on the block.
- **How loud it is, is the owner's** (2026-08-25, the fixed level being too quiet):
  `motion.keyVolume`,
  0-100, a plain linear fraction of a full scale defined once in `key-sound.ts`. The voice
  table holds the BALANCE — between the instruments, and between a letter and a space — and
  the slider is the only number that says how loud the whole thing is, so nothing about that
  balance changes when it moves. A row with no volume stored reads as the default 60. 0 is a
  real answer — the caret with the sound off — and is not the same setting as `keys: 'off'`.
- **The three instruments are levelled by measurement, not by eye** (`LEVEL` in
  `key-sound.ts`): A-weighting for the ear, plus a second-order high-pass at 250 Hz for the
  laptop speaker, geometric mean of the two. Their PEAKS therefore differ by 5:1 and that is
  correct — matching peaks is how the thock ends up inaudible and the crack ends up painful.
  A soft ceiling (`WaveShaper`, unity below 0.7) sits in front of the destination once,
  because the crest factors differ by 5× and two transients can land 14ms apart and add.
  Re-measure with the same method if a voice is retuned.
  The synthesis lives in `key-sound.ts`, apart from `key-feedback.ts`, because the settings
  screen plays a key as you drag the slider and must not pull the whole editor into its bundle
  to do it. A volume control you cannot hear while setting it is a trip to the editor per nudge.
  The sound is NOT gated by the motion engine or by reduced-motion: somebody who asked for
  less movement did not ask for silence, and those are not the same request.
- **The pen answers the hand** (2026-09-09, ADR 0049): a highlight, underline or ring JUST
  applied draws itself across the words — 200ms for the highlighter, 160 for the underline,
  240 for the ring — by growing the background the pen sheet already paints from nothing to
  its width. `pen-feedback.ts` notices the mark step after the fact and puts `pen-fresh` on
  the element for a beat; nothing enters the document, an existing mark never replays, and
  a document opening full of marks does not sweep. The words do not move. Gated by the two
  motion rules like everything else. With it, a felt-tip squeak (`pen-sound.ts`, rendered as
  arithmetic like the key click and measured by `pen-sound.test.ts`: 1.5-3 kHz, rising across
  a highlight, up and back around a ring), at `motion.penSqueak` — heard only with an
  instrument chosen and the slider above zero, and held at 0.45 of a key because it sits in
  the ear's loudest octave and lasts five times as long.
- **The writer is dealt the same eighty pens the page is** (2026-09-14): the published page
  hashes every gesture's Markdown into `data-pen="0".."79"` and `pen/ink.css.ts` gives each
  variant its own grip and die. The editor wrote no `data-pen` at all — the attribute does not
  appear anywhere in the history of `src/admin` — so every stroke in the writing surface came
  out of the four `var(--x, default)` fallbacks: one pen, however many strokes. Found by the
  underline sitting through the middle of the letters in the editor and at their feet on the
  page, which was the same cause. `pen-deal.ts` stamps the attribute on the drawn element from
  the element's own words, never in the document — the seed is a view concern, and a mark
  attribute would make two neighbouring strokes stop being one mark and save as `==a====b==`.
  THE STROKE UNDER THE HAND KEEPS ITS PEN: a hash of the words would change grip on every
  keystroke, so a stroke settles to the page's variant when the caret leaves it. One shape
  parts company on purpose — a stroke drawn across emphasis, a link, code or a formula hashes
  from the WORDS here and from the SOURCE on the page, so it is dealt a different one of the
  forty (6 of the 171 strokes on the live pages, all six in one post).
- **The caret stops blinking while the hands are moving**, and fades rather than switching:
  700ms past the last keystroke before it resumes, 1.2s ease-in-out, and never all the way
  to zero. A blink means "the cursor is here and nothing is happening", and during a burst of
  typing something plainly is.
- Autosave, revisions, preview tokens, media picking, taxonomy and publish behaviour are
  unchanged by any visual pass.
