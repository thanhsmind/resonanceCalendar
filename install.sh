# It clones the repository, installs, builds the two artefacts the server reads at runtime,
# and starts the blog in the foreground so the log prints the link that claims it. That log
# line IS the account step (docs/self-host.md §6): there is no shell command to run after.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do: install Bun, touch systemd, write an nginx vhost, ask
# for a password, or use sudo. Those are decisions with consequences on a server somebody
# else owns, and docs/self-host.md walks through them with the reasons attached. This
# script only does the mechanical part, and it is idempotent: run it again on the same
# directory and it updates and rebuilds instead of failing.
#
# Options, all through the environment so the pipe above keeps working:
#   QUIREINK_DIR=./quireink     where to put it (or pass it as the first argument)
#   SITE_URL=                   your public address; empty is fine while trying it locally
#   PORT=3000
#   NO_RUN=1                    install and build, but do not start it
#   QUIREINK_SOURCE=            clone from somewhere else (a fork, or a local path)
