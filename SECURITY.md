# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Report privately through GitHub's **[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/joiha-steven/quireink/security/advisories/new)**
(Security → Advisories on this repo). If that is unavailable, open a minimal public
issue asking a maintainer to make private contact — without any exploit detail.

Include what you can: affected version/commit, a description, reproduction steps or a
proof of concept, and the impact you foresee. We aim to acknowledge within a few days
and to ship a fix or mitigation before any public disclosure.

## Scope

Quire Ink is self-hosted, single-owner software. The trust model: the one account that claims the blog
(`/setup`, or `bun run user create`) is the owner, and the owner is trusted. Owner-only actions
(uploading media, editing content, custom CSS, uploading an SVG) are not vulnerabilities.

Reports we care about:

- **Anything reachable without a session** that reads or writes owner data, escapes the
  owner-gated router group, or forges an MCP token or OAuth code.
- **Authentication**: bypassing the password or the TOTP second factor, replaying a TOTP
  code or a recovery code, fixing or stealing a session, or defeating the rate limiter on
  the sign-in path.
- **Injection** reachable by a non-owner: SQL, path traversal out of the upload store,
  SSRF through a URL the app fetches, or stored XSS in reader comments, public pages or
  OG images.
- **Secret exposure to a client**: `users.password_hash`, `users.totp_secret`, recovery
  codes, `integration_keys` (SMTP password, Turnstile secret, Cloudflare token), MCP token
  hashes, or the server secret.

## What the current design already assumes

Stated so a report can say which of these is wrong, which is more useful than a scan.

- Sessions are a 32-byte CSPRNG token in a `__Host-` prefixed, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`,
  `SameSite=Lax` cookie. Only its SHA-256 is stored. The prefix scopes it to one host, so
  a session does not follow a domain change.
- Passwords are argon2id (`Bun.password`). TOTP is required once the blog has a public
  address; while it has none, first enrolment may be skipped once ([ADR 0030](./docs/decisions/0030-two-factor-can-wait-until-there-is-an-address.md)),
  and a used step is recorded so a code cannot be replayed. Ten single-use recovery codes are hashed at
  rest and shown once.
- Every write route is protected by **where it is mounted**, not by a check inside the
  handler, and a static guard (`bun run check:routes`) fails the build if a route escapes
  that group. See `docs/invariants.md`.
- Every SQL value is a bound parameter. The few statements assembled from a variable take a
  fixed identifier from a closed set, or a file path the server made itself, never input.
- Raw HTML in markdown and in comments is escaped, never executed, and `javascript:`,
  `data:` and `vbscript:` hrefs are dropped.
- Readers' words never drive the assistant unattended: once a conversation has read comments,
  every tool that writes waits for the owner's click (`docs/features/admin.md`, the assistant).
- The HTML the software itself writes ships **no inline script**, which is what lets the
  recommended CSP omit `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src`. A report that this is violated
  is a real finding. The one exception is by design: **Server & connections → Custom code** inserts
  whatever the owner pastes, verbatim, on public pages only (never the admin, the sign-in
  page or a preview). That is the owner's script on the owner's site, and it runs only where
  the owner's own policy allows it.
- Uploads are served from a single directory by exact path lookup; `..` and encoded
  variants do not escape it.

## Supported versions

Fixes land on `main`. Please test against the latest `main` before reporting.

**Quire 1.x** (tag `v1-final`: Next.js + PostgreSQL, Google sign-in via `AUTHORIZED_EMAIL`) is
unsupported and receives no fixes, security ones included. Say which tree you tested: a
1.x-only finding is documented, not patched.
