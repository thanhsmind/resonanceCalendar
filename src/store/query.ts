//
// This is deliberately NOT a query builder. The frozen tree used PostgREST's builder and
// the chains grew hard to read the moment a query stopped being trivial; a literal with
// bound parameters says exactly what runs. The hard rule in CLAUDE.md ("no SQL string
// building") is enforceable precisely because nothing here concatenates.
//
// Everything is synchronous, because `bun:sqlite` is. Modules that expose these keep
// their `async` signatures: their callers already await them, and changing that would
// turn a data-layer port into an edit of every route and component.
