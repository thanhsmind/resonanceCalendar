-- Quire Ink 2.0 content database (`quire.db`). Applied at boot, inside a transaction.
--
-- Translated from the Postgres schema (`../../v1/scripts/schema.sql`, 612 lines) per
-- docs/spec/01-schema.md. Read that document before changing anything here; it records why
-- each choice was made and what was rejected.
--
-- Conventions, applied everywhere without further comment:
--   * Timestamps are INTEGER MILLISECONDS since epoch, UTC. NULL stays NULL. There is no
--     DEFAULT: the application supplies every timestamp, because SQLite's own clock
--     functions would write text and silently break every comparison.
--   * Booleans are INTEGER 0/1, pinned by a CHECK.
--   * Identity columns are INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT. AUTOINCREMENT is REQUIRED,
--     not stylistic: see `comments` below.
--   * Row-level security is gone. It existed only to neuter the anon key, an artifact of
--     the Supabase origin. SQLite is in-process and has no second client.
--
-- Analytics lives in a separate file (`schema-analytics.sql`) so a pageview write never
-- queues behind a post save and the precious file stays small.

-- arrived through `import-v1`, which targets this schema directly. There IS a Quire Ink 2.0 in
-- the wild now, so steps that move an existing database to the shape below live in
-- `migrations.sql` and are named here as they are applied.

-- a cold database renders correctly and merely slower. Not emptied by `clearCache()`.
--
-- One producer since migration 019: Shiki highlighting, keyed by lang + theme pair + code.
-- The rendered post BODY was the second, keyed by build commit + media facts + markdown; it
-- moved to `body_cache` below, one row per piece, because keyed only by that hash a new render
-- had no old row to replace and every deploy left the last one behind (ADR 0062).
--
-- This comment used to say the body was deliberately NOT cached, because it "would have to
-- key on media variants, theme and locale". Two thirds of that was wrong — the theme is CSS
-- and never reaches the body HTML, and neither does the locale — and the third is in the
-- key rather than invalidated out of it. Measured on the live site 2026-07-29: `marked`
-- alone took 360ms on an 85,000-character post, and every write anywhere made the next
-- reader pay it again.

-- ADR 0062. The rendered BODY used to live in `render_cache` beside the highlighting, on the
-- same content-addressed terms, and that shape had no way to say "replace". `buildSha` is in
-- the key, so every deploy made every cached body unreachable and left it there for the
-- 30-day sweep to find. MEASURED on manhhung.me 2026-09-22: `render_cache` was 20,001 rows
-- and 502 MB holding about 5.6 MB of DISTINCT HTML, one body of 88,084 characters present
-- 204 times, while everything anybody had ever written came to 8 MB.
--
-- So the body is keyed by the PIECE and the hash is a column. The hash still decides hit from
-- miss on exactly the inputs it decided on before; what changed is that a piece owns one row
-- and a fresh render takes it. The table's size is the number of pieces.
--
-- ⚠️ A SLOT IS ONLY CORRECT WHILE A PIECE HAS ONE VALID RENDERING AT A TIME. Every input in
-- `bodyKey` is server-global or piece-global today. Put a theme, a locale or anything the
-- READER decides into that key and two renderings become valid at once, this row starts
-- thrashing between them, and content-addressing is the right shape again.

-- visitor hash was salted with it, falling back to the literal 'quire' when unset. A
-- constant salt makes a salted hash of IP + user agent reversible by anyone holding the

--
-- `first_done` is why `new=1` means "install" rather than "boot": it lives in the database,
-- so restoring a backup or moving the blog to another machine carries it along and is not
-- counted as a new install. That is the intended reading, not a limitation.
