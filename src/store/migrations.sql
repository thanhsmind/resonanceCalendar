-- Changes to an EXISTING content database. Applied at boot, after `schema.sql`, in order,
-- each inside its own transaction, each recorded in `schema_migrations`.
--
-- `schema.sql` states the FINAL shape and is what a fresh database is built from, so a
-- fresh database records every migration here as applied WITHOUT running it (see
-- `applyMigrations` in db.ts). That is the whole reason this file can hold plain
-- `alter table ... add column` statements: SQLite has no `if not exists` for a column, and
-- running one twice is an error rather than a no-op.
--
-- So a schema change is TWO edits, always: the new shape in `schema.sql`, and the step that
-- gets an existing database there from here. Doing only the first leaves the live instance
-- behind; doing only the second leaves a fresh install without the column.
--
-- Format: `-- migration: <name>` opens a step, everything until the next header is its SQL.
-- Names are ordered and never reused — the ledger keys on them.

-- ADR 0056: a piece can name the language it is written in, and pieces that say the same

--
-- `lang` NULL means "the site's language", which is what every row written before this had and
-- what most rows on most blogs will keep. It is NOT backfilled: writing the site's language
-- into every row would make "the owner chose this" and "nobody has said" the same fact, and

--
-- `tr_group` is a shared opaque id, not a slug. A slug rename would break a pairing stored as
-- one, and three languages are a graph rather than a chain — a group is the only shape that
-- holds both without a join table.
--
-- ⚠️ NO INDEX ON `tr_group`, and the reason is worth writing down because the first cut had
-- one and it broke every upgrade. `schema.sql` runs BEFORE the migrations, always, so an
-- index declared there against a column a migration is about to add is an index created
-- against a table that does not have it yet: "no such column: tr_group", on boot, on every
-- existing install. Declaring it only in the migration is no better — a FRESH database
-- RECORDS every step without running it, so the index would never exist there.

-- already reads whole on every listing, not by a second query, so the lookup costs nothing

-- migration: 017-link-cards
-- ADR 0058: a paragraph holding nothing but a link becomes a card, and what the card SAYS is
-- kept here rather than in the post. The markdown stays a bare URL — portable, exportable, and
-- the same line every other renderer in the world reads as a link — which is the same bargain
-- the video embed has made since the port.
--
-- ONE ROW PER URL, NOT PER MENTION. Two posts linking the same article share the fetch, the
-- stored picture and the title. The url IS the key, so nothing has to be cleaned up when a post
-- that mentioned it is edited or deleted; a row costs a few hundred bytes and answers for every
-- post that ever links there again.
--
-- `fetched_at` NULL MEANS PENDING, and that is the whole scheduling design. A save does not
-- reach out — it writes the URLs it saw with `insert or ignore` and returns, so saving a post
-- never waits on somebody else's server and a test never touches the network. The minute tick
-- takes the pending rows and fetches them, exactly as media variants are finalised off the
-- upload path. A card therefore appears within a minute of the save rather than during it.
--
-- `ok = 0` after a fetch means it was tried and yielded nothing useful — a 404, a page with no
-- title, a refusal. The row STAYS, so the fetch is not retried on every save forever, and the
-- paragraph renders as the plain link it already was. That is also exactly what the renderer
-- does for a row that has not been fetched yet, so there is one fallback and not two.
--
-- `image` is a path into THIS blog's own store, never a remote URL. A card that hotlinked its
-- picture would put a third-party request on a reader's page, which is the one thing the
-- reading side of this product does not do.

-- as this blog to every follower it has. A table nothing else reads is a table nothing else can

-- whose digest no longer matches is an `Update`, and a row whose post is no longer public is a
-- `Delete`. Self-healing, and it covers a path nobody has written yet.

-- `next_at` carries the backoff. A server that is down for a day should be tried a handful of
