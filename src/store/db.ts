// ceiling per CONNECTION and there are two of them, so it promised 128 MB to a process this
// project also ships in a 128 MB container. Measured 2026-09-23 against a 314 MB database,
// 20,000 point lookups, three runs each, in `--memory=128m --cpus=0.5` with the file on
// native container storage:
//
//   -64000   +57.0 / +56.8 / +56.9 MB resident   181 / 189 / 188 ms
//   -16000   +43.1 / +43.0 / +43.3 MB            142 / 146 / 132 ms
//    -8000   +26.4 / +34.5 / +33.8 MB            142 /  81 / 104 ms
//    -2000   +27.4 / +27.5 / +27.5 MB            141 / 126 / 108 ms
//
// 64 MB WAS THE SLOWEST OF THE FOUR, in every run and by about 30%. That is not a paradox:
// inside a cgroup, SQLite's private cache and the kernel's page cache come out of the SAME
// 128 MB, so a big private cache buys a second copy of pages it has just pushed the kernel
// into dropping. On an unconstrained machine the four are indistinguishable (121 / 127 / 120 /
// 121 ms), so nothing is given up on a large box either.
//
// 16 MB rather than the 2 MB that measured just as well: WHAT WAS MEASURED IS POINT LOOKUPS
// BY PRIMARY KEY, and the request path also runs FTS search, taxonomy joins and the analytics
// join across the ATTACHed file. Those are the shapes a page cache actually helps and none of
// them is in the number above, so the headroom stays until something measures them.
//
// It changes NOTHING for a blog whose database fits under the ceiling, which is every blog
// this project runs: after the 0062 migration the two largest are 11.2 MB and 4.6 MB, so the
// cache holds the whole file at either setting.
