// The tool surface as a NEUTRAL list, so it can have more than one door.
//
// Every tool file registers against `ToolHost` — a one-method interface the real
// `McpServer` satisfies structurally — instead of against McpServer itself. That one
// change is the whole trick: the MCP transport keeps calling `registerTools(server)`
// exactly as before, and anything else (the in-admin assistant this exists for) calls
// `collectTools()` to get the same tools as plain data — name, description, zod shape,
// handler — and drives them through its own provider's tool-calling dialect.
//
// One list, many doors, ONE rulebook: a tool absent here (the newsletter broadcast, the
// token mint) is absent from every door at once, which is what keeps the security story
// reviewable. Do not let a door grow a private tool.
