// The line-icon set, drawn ONCE — inner SVG markup keyed by name, worn by both faces of
// the product: `src/web/chrome.ts` wraps a body in a server-rendered <svg> and so does the
// admin's own `icon()` in `web/admin/kit.ts`. Before this file the
// reading site carried seven icons and the admin about thirty-seven more, each drawn by
// whoever needed it that day, in three stroke weights.
//
// The hand is the product's own, settled on an approved interactive board (the private
// repository keeps it under `brand/signal/`):
//   · stroke 1.8, round caps and joins — a pen moving on paper, not a die-cut pictogram;
//   · deliberate asymmetry where a grid would be sterile (the menu's short last bar) —
//     but never at the cost of the mark: the count of strokes is what says what a thing
//     IS, and only their lengths are free;
//   · FILLED DOTS as the signature, from the wordmark's full stop;
//   · the ECHO STROKE — one short line at stroke-width 1.4, placed only where the real
//     object carries a shadow or a fold: the glint inside a lens, the line under a mail
//     flap, the shade along a book's spine. Pure glyphs (close, chevrons, check, plus)
//     stay clean: they are marks, not objects, and an echo on a mark is decoration.
//
// Every body is drawn on a 24×24 viewBox and inherits colour and stroke from its wrapper,
// so a per-path `stroke-width="1.4"` is the ONLY local override an entry may carry.
// Editing a shape here changes it everywhere at once — which is the point.
