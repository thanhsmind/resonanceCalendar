// The four settings groups that are pure DATA: what a fresh install believes before anybody

//
// Moved out of `settings.ts` on 2026-08-29, when that file reached its 400-line ceiling for
// the fourth time. The seam is the one the previous three were cut on — by AUDIENCE.
// `settings.ts` answers "what is stored and how is it read back"; these four answer nothing,
// they are the answer. No logic, no imports but the types, and every one of them is read by
// `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` and by the sanitizer beside it.
//
// `settings.ts` re-exports all four, so no import site moved.
