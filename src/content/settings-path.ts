// One setting, named by a path — so something other than a hand-written form can change it.
//
// There are 245 leaf settings and, until this file, exactly one way to write any of them: a
// screen with a field on it. The admin's own search already knows 107 of them by NAME
// (`settings-index.ts`), which is what makes a setting findable; what it never knew was WHICH
// setting a row is, so nothing could act on the answer. This is that missing half.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS SAFE BECAUSE `saveSettings` DEEP-MERGES, and that was already true. Every nested
// group goes through its own sanitiser with the CURRENT value as the fallback —
// `sanitizeTypography(input.typography, current.typography)` walks every role and every style
// field — so a partial that mentions one leaf leaves the other 244 exactly where they were.
// That is not an assumption made here: `content/settings.test.ts` has pinned "a partial save
// leaves everything it did not mention alone" since 2026-08-02, when a patch carrying only a
// title reset `home.mode` and turned off somebody's composed front page.
//
// So a caller does NOT write to the database. It builds a partial and hands it to
// `saveSettings`, which sanitises it exactly as the admin's own Save button does. Nothing
// reachable this way is anything the owner's own screens could not already do.
