 * The URL slug for a series, with the same fallback taxonomy has (`content/taxonomy.ts`).
 *
 * ⚠️ `slugify` folds Latin and Cyrillic and drops the rest, so a series named in Japanese
 * slugs to the empty string. `content/series.ts` learned that in 2026-09 and fixed the public
 * route; this file kept a second copy of the arithmetic — `slugify(name)` with nothing after
 * it — and that copy is the one the admin's series drawer prints into `href="/series/…"`. It
 * printed `/series/`, which resolves to no series at all. One function now, and it lives here
 * because `series.ts` already imports from this file.
