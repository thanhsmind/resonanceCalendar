// What a settings save actually CHANGED.
//
// `settings.save` was written to the activity log with no detail at all, and it is the most
// frequent action there is: six rows of the same three words with an empty column beside
// them, which is what the home page's activity card was showing. The card had already been
// reported as too empty once, on 2026-08-15, and the answer then was to halve its width —
// which treated the air rather than the reason for it. There was nothing to say because
// nothing was being recorded.
//
// A ledger of changes should say which. Paths rather than prose, and stored raw like every
// other detail in this table, because the log outlives whatever language the admin happens
// to be in today.
