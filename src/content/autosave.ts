// The editor's autosave, on the server — and the promise that it never reaches a reader.
//
// The editor has autosaved to `localStorage` since M2, deliberately: writing an in-progress
// draft to `posts.content` would put half a sentence on a PUBLISHED page, and no interval is
// short enough to make that acceptable. That left one real gap, and it is the one nobody
// notices until it costs them: the work existed on exactly one browser. A dead laptop, a
// cleared profile, a machine left at the office — everything typed since the last Save was
// gone, and the local snapshot could not say otherwise because it went with the machine.
//
// So the snapshot lands in a column of its own. `posts.content` is still moved by an explicit
// Save and by nothing else, so the live page is exactly what was last published; `autosave_json`
// is a side note the editor offers back when it is newer than the row.
//
// ⚠️ UNIFORM FOR DRAFTS AND PUBLISHED POSTS, and that is a decision rather than laziness. The
// obvious shortcut is "a draft is not live, so autosave straight into its row" — and it is a
// RACE: a draft can be published a second later, and the status this code read is already
// stale by the time the row is written. One path that is safe for the dangerous case is safer
// than two paths where the cheap one is only usually right.
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING THAT RENDERS A PAGE MAY READ THESE COLUMNS. `getPost`, the feeds, the sitemap and
// the search index all select named columns and none of them names this one; `store/autosave.test.ts`
// holds that.
