// How a table in an article is drawn, and the CSS variables that carry it.
//
// A file of its own for the reason `settings-shape.ts` is one: `settings-sanitize.ts` was at
// 364 of its 400 lines, and the seam is real either way — everything here answers "what does
// a table look like", and all of it turns into custom properties rather than into markup.
//
// WHY A SETTING AT ALL. A table was four declarations: collapse the borders, fill the column,
// box every cell in a hairline, pad it. A `<th>` had no ground, no weight of its own beyond
// the browser's bold, and no rule under it — so a header row was one more row. Nothing here
// could be said in Markdown either, because GFM has no syntax for a tint or a rule, which is
// also why this is ONE SET FOR THE WHOLE BLOG: an attribute carried in the source would make
// the table stop being something anybody can paste in or out.
//
// The numbers below were chosen against a real article of six tables (2026-08-29) — one
// timeline of three short columns, five reference tables of two columns with cells past 150
// characters — and then measured on the rendered page rather than picked by eye.

/**
 * Every ground here is MIXED from the palette, never named — and it is the INK that gets
 * mixed into the paper, not the rule.
 *
 * Mixing at all is what survives a theme: six palettes and a dark mode, so a grey named
 * here would be a grey that is wrong in ten of them. `--c-code-panel` one file over mixes
 * `--c-rule` into `--c-bg` and that was the first thing tried here — but a rule colour is
 * already almost the paper, so the mix is capped by it. Measured on the default palette:
 * paper rgb(252,252,252), rule rgb(235,235,235), so even 100% of the rule lands 6.7% darker
 * than the page and 35% of it gave rgb(246,246,246) — a contrast ratio of 1.053, which is a
 * band you have to be told is there.
 *
 * `--c-text` has the palette's full range in it, so a small percentage of the ink buys a
 * visible wash and the number means the same thing in every theme: in dark mode the same 6%
 * lifts the band off the page instead of pressing it in, because the ink is the light one
 * there. Tuned by reading the rendered pixels back, not by eye.
