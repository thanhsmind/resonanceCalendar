/**
 * Slugs the router answers before `/{slug}` ever runs, so a post or page saved at one of
 * them is stored, listed, put in the sitemap, and unreachable forever with nothing saying
 * why. "Search" and "Login" are ordinary page titles, and `slugify` turns both into exactly
 * these strings.
 *
 * MEASURED, not guessed, and `slugs.test.ts` keeps it measured: a fixed route only shadows
 * a slug when it is one bare segment (`/search`) or a segment with a wildcard under it
 * (`/uploads/*`, which Hono matches with the wildcard empty). A parameter does not, so
 * `/assets/:file` leaves `assets` free and `/api/track` leaves `api` free. That is why this
 * list is nine names and not the twenty a reading of `app.ts` would suggest.
 *
 * `archive` is deliberately NOT here. `/archive` asks for the owner's own document first
 * and only draws the year index when there is none, which is the opposite trade and is set
 * out where that route is registered.
