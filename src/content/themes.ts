//
// DARK BEFORE THE ISLAND SPEAKS. `.dark` is applied by `assets/js/theme.ts`, a deferred
// module, so a reader whose system is dark on the default `system` mode was shown a white
// page for one paint on every navigation — measured: 0 `prefers-color-scheme` rules in 429.
//
// ⚠️ `data-scheme`, NOT `data-theme`: `<body data-theme>` already exists and holds the
// translated word "Theme" for the island's button label. Two same-named attributes on parent
// and child, one a sentence and one a mode, is a mix-up waiting to happen.
//
// The handoff is `data-scheme` on `<html>`. Nothing server-rendered sets it — the page cache
// is keyed by URL alone (Invariant 1), so a server-rendered mode would be the first visitor's
// mode for everyone — the island sets it to the RESOLVED light/dark the moment it runs, and
// this block applies only while it is absent.
//
// The honest cost: a reader who explicitly chose LIGHT on a dark system now gets the inverse
// flash, for as long as the dark reader used to get theirs. `system` is the default and by far
// the common case, so this moves the flash off the many onto the few. Removing it entirely
// needs an inline script, which this project asserts it does not have.
//
// `color-scheme` rides along: it is what makes the scrollbar, the form controls and the canvas
// follow the page instead of staying light under a dark one.
//
// NOT mirrored per palette, and that is settled rather than deferred: before the island runs
// there is no `data-palette` at all, so the only palette this block could be about is the
// owner's default — which `base` already carries. After it runs, this whole block drops out of
// the cascade. Real cost, zero benefit.
