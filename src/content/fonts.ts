// FONTS: the reading presets, the chrome face, and the typography tuned for each.
//
// Split out of `themes.ts` on 2026-08-15 for the same reason `palettes.ts` was in August:
// the file held two subjects and the 400-line cap came due. The seam is real rather than
// arbitrary — a PALETTE is colour and a PRESET is a typeface plus the reading setup that
// face wants, and nothing here reads a theme.
//
// The dependency runs ONE WAY. This file imports nothing from `themes.ts`; `themes.ts`
// re-exports everything below, so all 22 existing importers are untouched. Do not add an
// import back the other way: `FONT_PRESETS` is built at module load by `tuned()`, and a
// cycle would have it read `DEFAULT_TYPOGRAPHY` before that const is initialised — a
// temporal-dead-zone crash at boot, not a type error.

// Tuned for long-form reading the way fine European book typography is set:
//  - 18px body (--fs-body 1.125rem) at a ~66-char measure (contentWidth 672) — the
//    classic 60-75 cpl comfort zone (Bringhurst's ideal ~66).
//  - Body leading 1.7: airy enough for screens, a touch tighter than the old 1.75
//    so the column reads as an even grey block rather than spaced-out lines.
//  - A restrained, monotonic heading scale (h1 2.0 → h5 1.0). Headings stay modest
//    (books differentiate with weight + whitespace, not size); larger sizes take
//    tighter leading + a little negative tracking, body/small stay at 0.
//  - h4 sits just above body; h5 is the small label (was 0.9, below body — fixed).
//  - `small` at 0.9375 (15px), not 0.875 (14px). It is not a minor role: dates, tags,
//    footnotes, the footer, the related list and the whole comment thread are all set in
//    it, so it is most of the page that is not the article. 14px against an 18px body is
//    0.78 of it, which is a bigger drop than book typography uses for secondary matter;
//    0.83 keeps the hierarchy and stops the furniture reading as fine print.
//  - `caption` follows it up to 0.875 (14px) for the same reason: it labels a photograph
//    the reader is looking at, and 13px under an 18px column was a squint.
// Mirror any change in the table in docs/conventions/type.md.

//     large), so a high-priority preload would contend with the render-blocking CSS and

/**

 * None of the bundled faces carries a Han, kana or hangul glyph and none ever will — a CJK
 * webfont is megabytes. That is about what we SHIP, and was never an argument for letting the
 * stack end at the generic keyword: a missing glyph does not fail, the browser reaches past
 * the whole list to its own last-resort face, and that choice is nobody's. The page renders
 * differently on every machine, at an optical size nothing here picked. Naming the faces costs
 * zero bytes — they are already installed — and takes the choice back.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE STACK CANNOT SERVE ALL THREE LANGUAGES. 直, 直 and 直 are one Unicode character drawn
 * three ways, and a font-family list resolves to the first INSTALLED family without consulting
 * the language of the text. A single tail headed by `PingFang SC` sets Japanese prose in
 * Chinese letterforms on every Mac — not a fallback, the primary rendering. The first cut did
 * exactly that, and put Yu Mincho ahead of SimSun for Windows readers too.
 *
 * Hence one tail PER LANGUAGE, and `cjkLangCss` to switch on `:lang()`. The day a post carries
 * its own language the same rules start working per post with no change here.
