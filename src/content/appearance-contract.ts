// What custom CSS is allowed to rely on, in ONE place.
//
// This product ships no themes. A reader of `docs/appearance.md` gets 155 knobs and, when
// the knobs run out, their own CSS — so the escape hatch is not a convenience here, it is
// the whole of the answer to "make it look like mine". The doc says so out loud: *"These
// names are part of what the software promises you. They will not be renamed without a note
// in the changelog."*
//
// ⚠️ THAT PROMISE WAS HELD BY NOBODY UNTIL 2026-08-31. Rename a variable or a class and every
// custom stylesheet in the wild breaks on the next update, silently, on somebody else's blog
// — and `check:all` stayed green, because no test and no guard had ever read the list. It is
// the same shape as every other escape found this week: a rule kept by discipline.
//
// So the list lives here rather than in the prose, and three things read it: `check:contract`
// proves every name still exists in the code AND that the doc lists exactly these names, and
// the Custom CSS box offers them to the owner. One list, three readers, no copy to drift.
//
// This module is DATA ONLY — no imports, so the admin bundle can hold it without dragging
// anything server-side across the boundary (`check:bundle`).

/** One promised name, and the one line the owner needs to know what it does. */
