//
// Two controls, one file, because both do the same thing: flip one attribute on `<html>`
// and let CSS do the rest. Neither re-renders anything.
//
// THE FIRST PAINT IS THE STYLESHEET'S, NOT THIS FILE'S. The frozen tree applied the saved
// mode in a pre-paint inline script; 2.0 has no inline script anywhere — that property is
// tested, and the article page's script count is a number in an assertion — so for the
// length of one paint the page is whatever CSS alone can decide. A cookie would let the
// server decide instead, but the page cache is keyed by URL alone (Invariant 1), so a
// cached page would carry whichever mode the first visitor happened to have.
//
// So CSS decides it, with a `prefers-color-scheme` block that applies only while `<html>`
// has no `data-scheme` (`content/themes.ts`), and this file's job is to set that attribute —
// which both hands over from the media query and records the reader's actual choice. A
// system-dark reader on the default mode now opens dark on the first frame; it was a white
// flash on every navigation.
//
// `data-scheme` is the RESOLVED light/dark, never the mode: 'system' and 'time' are questions,
// and the attribute has to be an answer or the CSS cannot use it.

 * it; a test process carries as many as its files build, and module state is shared across
 * files in one Bun run. Two assertions in `palette.test.ts` went red in CI and green on the
