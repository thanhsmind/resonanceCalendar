// Book mode ON A PHONE: one column, scrolled, with the chrome that gets out of the way.
//
// A separate door from the desktop spread, and the reason is the browser's own furniture.
// The spread is a <dialog>, and a modal dialog takes the scroll off the document — which on
// iOS means Safari's address bar and toolbar STAY, because they only retract while the page
// itself is scrolling. Measured on an iPhone: 844px of glass, 190px of it Safari's, another
// 56 of ours, leaving under 600 for the words; turning nineteen pages of that is turning a
// page every four sentences.
//
// So on a phone the reader is not a dialog at all. The page's own content is hidden, the
// article is laid out as one tall column IN THE DOCUMENT, and the reader scrolls the
// document — which is what hands the toolbars back to the words. Leaving book mode puts the
// page back exactly where it was, scroll position included.
//
// The chrome then behaves the way a reading app's does: gone on the way down, back on the
// way up, always one short scroll away. It is fixed rather than sticky so that Safari
// collapsing its own bars does not shove it around mid-gesture.
