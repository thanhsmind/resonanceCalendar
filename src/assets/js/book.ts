// The heaviest island in the site, and the only one that is genuinely optional: the base
// page keeps its normal scroll, so nothing here affects reading, SEO or accessibility. It
// exists because a long essay reads better in columns than in one tall ribbon.
//
// A `<dialog>`, so Escape and the inert background come from the browser. The columns come
// from CSS `column-width`, and "turning a page" is one transform on the flow under a
// clipping viewport: the browser has already done the pagination, and re-implementing it
// in JavaScript is how this kind of feature becomes a measurement loop that fights the
// layout engine. (It was one `scrollLeft` assignment until Chrome 148 stopped treating a
// multicol's overflow columns as scrollable overflow — the comment in `goto` has the
// measurements.)
//
// Book mode is its OWN standard rather than the site theme: paper and ink, not the reader's
// palette. That is deliberate, and carried over from the frozen tree.
