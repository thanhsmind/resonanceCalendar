// Select a sentence, and take it with you.
//
// This is the one reading gesture the platforms this product is measured against all have
// and this one did not: on Medium a selection raises a small menu, and that menu is why
// their sentences travel. Selecting text here did nothing at all.
//
// What it copies is deliberately NOT a share button. There is no third party in this
// product and no account behind it, so the useful version is the one a reader can paste
// anywhere: the sentence, and a link that opens the post scrolled to that exact sentence.
//
// The link is a TEXT FRAGMENT (`#:~:text=`), which is why nothing in the renderer had to
// change. Paragraphs have no ids and are not getting any: adding them would rewrite the
// HTML that `golden/` holds as the contract for what this renderer prints. A browser that
// does not know text fragments simply opens the post at the top, which is the same thing
// the link would have done anyway — the definition of a gesture that may be added freely.
