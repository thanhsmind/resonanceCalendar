//
// The current section is the LAST heading that has passed the reading line, not the one

 * The end-of-article facts exist TWICE, and only one copy is ever on screen.
 *
 * Below the rail breakpoint the tags and categories sit under the article; above it that
 * block is `display:none` and the same facts are in the gutter panel, at the TOP of the
 * article. The contents list's last row is server-rendered pointing at the block under the
 * article, which is right on a phone and wrong on a desktop: it jumped the reader a
 * screenful past the end of the prose to a zero-height anchor, landing on "Read next" with
 * no tag anywhere in sight. Measured on a 1466px window, 2026-09-02: 2,615px of scroll to
 * reach nothing the row named. Reported as issue #63.
 *
 * So the row follows the copy that is actually rendered. Re-decided on resize because the
 * thing that decides is a viewport width, and a window that crosses the breakpoint without
 * a reload would otherwise keep aiming at the copy that has just been hidden.
 *
 * With no JavaScript the row keeps the server's choice, which is the correct one at the
 * width where there is no gutter to hold the other copy.
