// every comment was rejected and the form looked broken. A verifier with nothing to verify
// is not a half-built feature; it is a closed door.
//
// The script is loaded ONCE and only on a page that actually renders a form, so a reader
// who never opens the comments never fetches it — and a site with Turnstile off never
// references Cloudflare at all.
