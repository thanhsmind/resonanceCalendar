 * reader may see one frame of list first.

  // ⚠️ WATCH THE CARDS THAT ARRIVE LATER TOO. This observed the cards the server sent with the
  // page and nothing else, and the tail of the archive is fetched a page at a time by the
  // very same function — so on an engine taking this path, every card past the first page was
  // appended already carrying `opacity: 0` with nothing left to take it off. The reader
  // scrolled into a run of blank cards: real height, real gaps between them, no words. It
  // only shows where view() timelines do not exist, which is why it could sit unnoticed on a
  // Chrome that never runs this branch at all.
  //
  // ⚠️ AND A BACKSTOP FOR THE ENGINES THAT DO HAVE view(). Reported from the reading page on
  // Safari, 2026-09-13: now and then, one card in the middle of the window stays part-faded
  // while its neighbours are solid. It could not be reproduced in Chrome — 77 cards over
  // 18,881px, nothing under 0.95 opacity that was fully inside the window — and both engines
  // run the same declaration, so what differs is when the range is RESOLVED. This list grows
  // while it is read: the tail is appended a page at a time, and a view() range computed
  // before that and not recomputed after leaves a card standing mid-animation for ever.
  //
  // So `.is-set` ends the animation once a card is FULLY inside the window, which is the same
  // instant `entry 100%` ends it on an engine that resolved the range correctly — there, this
  // changes nothing anyone can see. Where the range went stale, it is the difference between
  // a card you can read and a card that stays grey. The fade itself is still CSS and still off
