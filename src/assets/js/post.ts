// The bundle for `/{slug}`: everything a reader gets on a post or a static page.
//
// The frozen tree mounted these as separate React islands, each behind a server-side
// condition (`content.includes('```')`, `imageUrls.length > 0`). Here they are ONE file
// and each part guards itself on the markup it needs, so a post with no code and no images
// loads the same bundle and runs two cheap queries that find nothing. That is a transport
// change, not a behaviour change: the frozen tree split them because React's per-island
// cost was real, and this whole bundle is smaller than one of those islands was.
//
// The reading-progress bar is NOT here. It is CSS (`animation-timeline: scroll()`), which
// is why it also works with JavaScript switched off.
//
// Neither are book mode and the comment thread, since 2026-09-06: they are the two islands
// behind an owner's switch, and together they were three quarters of this file. Each is its
// own bundle (`book-mode.ts`, `comment-thread.ts`), emitted only when its switch is on.
