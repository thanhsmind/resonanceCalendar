// Bring remote images home: find every image a post or page still loads from another
// host, fetch it through the SSRF guard, add it to the media library, and rewrite the
// references. This is the missing half of a move — every importer converts the words
// and leaves the pictures where they were, which reads fine right up until the old
// host is switched off.
//
// The importers stay PURE parsers on purpose (see wordpress.ts); this module is the
// I/O half, and it deliberately keeps NO import-time state. Each call re-reads the
// content and asks "what is still remote?", which buys three things at once: the work
// happens in small batches (a photo blog can point at hundreds of images on a slow
// host, and fetching them all inside one upload request lets some proxy's read timeout
// decide how the story ends), a crash mid-way loses nothing (the untouched posts still
// point at URLs that still work), and a blog imported before this module existed is
// served exactly as well as one imported today.
//
// The admin client and the MCP tool both call it in a loop: each call moves up to
// `IMAGE_BATCH` images and reports how many remain. A caller should stop when
// `remaining` is 0 — or when a call moves nothing, which means what is left is only
// failures and retrying them buys the same errors again.
