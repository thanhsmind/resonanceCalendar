// The shared half of every importer: HTML in, clean Markdown out, plus the small tools
// each platform parser needs (entity decoding, unique slugs, excerpts).
//
// Split out of `wordpress.ts` on 2026-08-23, when Ghost, Substack and Medium arrived.
// The seam is by JOB: a platform module knows where that platform keeps its fields and
// nothing about Markdown; this file knows Markdown and nothing about any platform.
//
// The deterministic cleanup lives here ON PURPOSE, and there is no AI in it: shortcodes,
// non-breaking spaces and blank-line pileups have exact fixes, and an exact fix should
// never be outsourced to a model. (An agent CAN be asked to polish imported posts further
// — that is a cookbook recipe, working through the same revisioned saves as everything.)
