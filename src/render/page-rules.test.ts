// WHAT THIS BLOG ANSWERS, as against what the engine asks.
//
// `md/html-rules.test.ts` measures the engine's half — each rule doing what it says when a
// host asks for it. This measures the two answers that could not stay in the engine, because
// both of them are the rest of the application: a slug function that knows Vietnamese and
// Cyrillic, and Temml.
//
// It is the only place that checks the wiring at all. `PAGE` is one object literal, and a
// `math` left at `null` in it would publish every formula on the site as its own TeX with
// nothing going red — the page would still render, and nobody reads MathML by eye.
