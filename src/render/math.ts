// Mathematics: LaTeX in the Markdown, MathML on the page.
//
// The whole feature is server-side. Temml turns the TeX into MathML at render time and the
// reader downloads NOTHING extra for it — no script, no stylesheet, no font file. That is
// the only reason this could be added at all: the resource-loading law (`docs/performance.md`)
// budgets a reader's JavaScript in single kilobytes, and both of the usual answers spend far
// more than the whole budget. KaTeX ships ~23 KB of CSS plus a family of WOFF2 faces before
// it draws a glyph; MathJax is an order of magnitude worse and runs in the reader's browser.
// MathML is drawn by the browser's own layout engine using its own maths face, so the cost
// on the page is the markup and nothing else.
//
// WHY TEMML AND NOT KATEX. KaTeX can emit MathML (`output: 'mathml'`), so it looked like the
// same trade with a better-known name. It is not: KaTeX's MathML was built as an accessibility
// track running ALONGSIDE its HTML output, which is the thing actually drawn, and standalone
// it renders visibly worse. Temml was written by a KaTeX contributor for exactly this job —
// MathML as the only output — and that is the job here.
//
// THE GRAMMAR IS NOT HERE. It moved to `math-syntax.ts`, whole and unedited, and that file
// says why: importing Temml at the top of the module that also owns the regexes meant a
// LaTeX engine rode `@/utils` into every admin screen. Everything it exports is re-exported
// below, so a parser that needs both halves still asks one module for them.
//
// WHAT MAY LIVE IN THIS FILE is anything that RENDERS or TOKENIZES: it already costs Temml
// and `marked`. Anything that only needs to recognise a formula belongs next door.

 * hardcoded firebrick baked into a CACHED body could not be restyled by any palette the
 * reader picks — rendered bodies are stored under a hash of their Markdown, so the colour
 * would outlive the setting that was supposed to control it.
 *
 * The fallback shows the writer's own source, escaped, marked with a class the sheet styles.
 * It does not swallow the formula and it does not show a stack trace: a typo in `\frac` must
 * leave something you can read and correct, on the page where you can see it is wrong.
