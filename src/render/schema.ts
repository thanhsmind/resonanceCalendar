// JSON-LD structured data: the `seo.autoSchema` setting, finally attached to something.
//
// The setting shipped in `SeoSettings` with a default of TRUE and a line in the admin
// promising "structured data for Google: WebSite on the home page, BlogPosting on each
// post". Nothing read it. `grep -rn 'ld+json' src/` returned nothing at all, and
// `docs/seo-pwa.md` recorded it honestly under "not carried over" — but the owner's own
// settings screen did not, so it read as a feature that was on. A switch wired to nothing
// is worse than a missing feature: the missing one asks to be built, this one lies.
//
// TWO shapes only, matching what the setting says. Pages (About, Colophon) get none: a
// `WebPage` object that restates the `<title>` and the canonical adds no fact a crawler did
// not already have from the tags beside it, and every object here has to earn its bytes.
//
// ABSOLUTE URLs or nothing. `resolveSiteUrl` returning empty means the owner has not told
// the software where it lives, and the same rule the canonical follows applies here: no
// schema is better than schema full of `http://localhost:3000`. That exact string reached
// production once already, in the feed and the sitemap.

 * refuses to print "Updated" for a save within 24 hours of publishing for the same reason —
 * this is that judgement in a second place, and both read the same column.

 *
 * There was no owner-name setting until 2026-08-29 — single owner (ADR 0002), and the only
 * name on record was `users.username`, which is half a credential and never leaves the
 * server — so every BlogPosting this software had ever produced went out authorless, on
 * every blog. This comment used to say "when a display name exists, an author belongs here
 * as a Person"; `settings.author.name` is that display name, and this is that Person.
 *
 * Absent when the name is '' rather than emitted empty: a blank `author` is a worse claim
 * than no claim. `publisher` carries the site either way, which is true regardless.
