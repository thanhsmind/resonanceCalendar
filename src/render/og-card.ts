// The Open Graph card: 1200x630, rendered on the server, no browser involved.
//
// `next/og` was satori (JSX to SVG) plus a WASM rasteriser. Here it is satori plus sharp,
// which is already a dependency and already rasterises SVG. The element tree is built as
// plain objects rather than JSX: satori accepts either, and plain objects avoid giving this
// one file a different JSX pragma from the rest of the codebase.
//
// THE CARD IS A PAGE FROM THE SITE, NOT A BANNER. It was a dark gradient with white text on
// it, which is what every generated card on the web looks like and which said nothing about
// what a reader would find on the other side of the link. It is now paper, set in the site's
// own face, with the title and the date under the SAME highlighter stroke the reader meets
// inside an article — the literal pen from `pen/ink.css.ts`, the same measured pigment and
// the same hand-drawn edges, carried here as the SVG it already is.
//
// The pen is the one part of this file that does not follow the palette, and deliberately:
// ADR 0018 fixes its pigment across every theme because a highlighter is a physical object,
// not a UI colour. A card built around the pen therefore has no palette to follow either.
//
// Rasterised at 2x. satori emits SVG, so the resolution is sharp's to choose (`density`),
// and 72 DPI was leaving the type visibly soft on any hi-DPI phone — which is where a
// shared link is opened.
