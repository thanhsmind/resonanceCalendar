// Guess the language of a fence that did not name one.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A fence with no info string highlights as `text`, which has no tokens, so
// the block renders in one flat colour. That is correct and it is also how most people write:
// three backticks, paste, done. The owner's own blog is full of them, and the report was
// simply "so there is no colour?" — the colour was there all along and only for the posts
// that had remembered a word after the backticks.
//
// WHY IT IS DELIBERATELY TIMID. A wrong guess is worse than no guess: terminal OUTPUT in a
// fence is the commonest untagged block there is, and colouring stray words inside an error
// message makes the page look broken rather than rich. So every rule below needs a signal
// that prose and program output do not produce by accident — a shebang, a command name in
// the first position, an SQL verb, a tag, a brace with a quoted key. Anything under that bar
// stays `text`, which is exactly what it renders as today.
//
// It only ever runs for a fence that named NOTHING. A writer who tags a block is obeyed, even
// when the tag is wrong, because that is a choice and this is a fallback.
//
// ⚠️ THAT SENTENCE WAS NOT TRUE UNTIL 2026-09-16. `highlight.ts` carried twenty-one language
// names by hand and sent everything else here, so a fence that DID name a language got read by
// the Python rule below the moment its first line opened `def ` or `class ` — which is how
// ```ruby and ```elixir were published coloured as Python. The rule is enforced there now.

/**
 * The guesses this is allowed to make. Deliberately a short list and not every grammar
 * Shiki has: a guess is a claim about text nobody labelled, so the bar is a signal prose
 * and program output do not produce by accident. `highlight.ts` normalises these to the
 * grammar id Shiki files them under, so `ts` here becomes `typescript` there.
