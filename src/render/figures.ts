 * `<figure>` and leaving it there hands the browser `<p>…<figure>…</figure>…</p>`, which its
 * parser repairs by CLOSING the paragraph before the figure. What comes out is an empty `<p>`,
 * the figure, and the rest of the sentence as a BARE TEXT NODE with no paragraph around it.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COSTS, measured on the live site after the fix landed, 2026-09-14: the run of words
 * after a picture is now `text-align:justify` with `hyphens:auto` and a 25.3px top margin, and
 * as a bare text node it had none of them — `.prose` itself is `text-align:start`, so that one
 * paragraph sat ragged-right and unhyphenated in the middle of a justified piece. NOT the
 * first-line indent: `figure + p` sets that to 0 on purpose (`prose.css.ts`), so it read the
 * same either way and an earlier note here said otherwise.
