// A code block that belongs to no language, marked only where the marking cannot be wrong.
//
// WHY NOT JUST PICK A GRAMMAR. Measured before writing this, on a block of Vietnamese
// pseudocode from a real post: forced through `bash`, Shiki coloured `id` and `nếu` as
// commands and swallowed the run `tìm cert có … trùng` as a string, because it read the one
// pair of quotes as shell quoting. Six words of prose in the string colour is not richer than
// plain — it is a page that looks broken. A grammar is a claim about what the text IS, and for
// an untagged fence there is no such claim to make.
//
// WHAT IS TRUE ANYWAY. Two things survive not knowing the language, and only two:
//
//   • a run inside a matched pair of quotes, on one line, is quoted material — in shell, in
//     pseudocode, in a config file, in a log line;
//   • `$NAME` and `${NAME}` is a substitution, and there is no notation in which it reads as
//     ordinary words.
//
// Nothing else made the cut. Numbers are prose ("chín mươi ngày" is not code). A leading `#`
// is a comment in six languages and a heading in Markdown and a channel in a chat log.
// Keywords belong to grammars. So this marks two kinds of thing and leaves every other
// character exactly as the writer typed it.
//
// It runs ONLY when `detect-lang.ts` has already declined to guess, which is what keeps it
// honest: a block that could be identified never reaches here.
