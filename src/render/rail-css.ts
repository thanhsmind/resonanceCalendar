// Rail geometry as CSS strings, injected at runtime because a media query can't read a
// CSS variable — the breakpoint is COMPUTED from the reading-column width. Shared by the
// blog layout (single left ToC rail, post/default width) and the listing sidebar (TWO
// rails + a narrower column). Keep in sync with globals.css `.rail` base + `--rail-*`.
//
// The column width is exposed as `--shell-w` (the layout's shell reads it, falling back to
// the owner's contentWidth). Listing pages set a narrower `--shell-w` AND emit the two-rail
// rules; because those use the higher-specificity `.rail.rail-left` / `.rail.rail-right`
// selectors, they win over the layout's single-rail `.rail` rules with no ordering games.

// THE DIVIDERS SIT BEHIND (z-index:-1). Each is a pseudo-element of `.rail`, so it paints
// AFTER the rail's own children — and a marker inside cannot climb over it, because
// `.rail-inner` is position:sticky and therefore a stacking context that traps any
// z-index below it. The IDE chrome's numbered rings sit ON this line, and without this
// the hairline drew straight through every one of them. Same shape of bug as the feed's
// spine over the month dots, same fix.
