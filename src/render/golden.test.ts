// The M2 gate, at the level it can be held today: for every corpus fixture, Quire Ink 2.0's
// article body is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the frozen implementation's.
//
// The reference HTML in `golden/v1/corpus/` was produced by actually running the frozen
// renderer (`golden/capture-corpus.ts`), not written by hand. Hand-written expectations
// would only test that I transcribed my own port correctly, which is the thing least worth
// testing.
//
// `shiki` is pinned to an EXACT version in `package.json`, no caret. A byte comparison
// against a floating dependency would fail on a patch release and teach everyone to ignore
// it. `marked` was pinned beside it until ADR 0052 took it out; the engine that replaced it
// is ours, so its version is this repository's own history and there is nothing to pin.
//
// The pins were no longer the frozen tree's own (18.0.5 / 4.2.0): the 2026-08-11 security
// pass moved them to 18.0.9 and 4.4.3 and re-ran this gate, which stayed 46/46. That is what
// the pins are FOR — a bump is a reviewed change that has to prove it moved nothing, not a
// number nobody may touch. Deliberately not restated here as a version number, because the
// last one sat in this comment untrue from the day of the bump.

/**
 * THE THIRD TIER, added when this blog stopped renting its Markdown engine (ADR 0052).
 *
 * The two tiers above both end in a byte comparison, and both should: one says a port moved
 * nothing, the other says a deliberate change moved exactly what it said it would. Neither can
 * express what a REPLACED ENGINE promises. `src/md/` is written to CommonMark and `marked` was
 * not, so the two spell a line break `<br />` and `<br>`, and one writes a newline between two
 * block tags where the other does not. Those are real bytes. No reader can see one of them.
 *
 * A gate that reports those the same way it reports a lost sentence is a gate somebody turns
 * off, so the names below are held to a different and narrower claim: they differ from 1.x
 * ONLY through `html-equivalence.ts`'s ladder, and the rung is named here. A difference that
 * survives the ladder fails, and the whole difference is printed.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS TIER IS FOR WHITESPACE AND SPELLING, never for behaviour. Anything a reader could
 * notice belongs in DIVERGED with a reason, or is a bug. The ladder is what enforces that —
 * it cannot dissolve a changed word, a lost tag or a moved attribute.

/**
 * THE FIXTURES THAT NO LONGER MATCH 1.x, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A REGRESSION.
 *
 * Everything above this point is a parity gate: 2.0's body is byte-identical to the frozen
 * implementation's. Some fixtures stopped being, deliberately, and the honest way to record
 * that is here rather than by overwriting `golden/v1/` — those files are what 1.x ACTUALLY
 * PRINTED, captured by running it, and a renderer that no longer exists cannot be re-run to
 * get them back. Overwriting them would not update the reference; it would destroy it, and
 * the gate would go on reporting parity against our own output.
 *
 * So 1.x's answer stays on disk untouched, the new answer lives beside it in `golden/v2/`,
 * and each name is listed here with the BEHAVIOUR it belongs to and the reason it moved.
 *
 * `behaviour` is the field that matters, and it is why this shape changed on 2026-08-25.
 * The guard below used to count NAMES and refuse a fourth. But the three names it was sized
 * against were one behaviour wearing three fixtures, and the comment here always said so —
 * "a divergence in ONE behaviour, not a licence to drift". Counting names made a second
 * correct change impossible for an arithmetic reason nobody chose, which is a rule guarding
 * the wrong thing. It counts behaviours now, and keeps a bound on names so that one
 * behaviour cannot quietly eat the corpus.
