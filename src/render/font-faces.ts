// The `@font-face` declarations for the self-hosted families.
//
// THIS FILE EXISTED NOWHERE, and its absence was invisible: the settings named
// 'Literata' and 'JetBrains Mono', the layout preloaded their .woff2 files, the routes
// served those files with a 200 — and no rule ever told the browser what they were. Every
// page fell back to Georgia and a system serif, so the site rendered in the wrong two
// faces at the wrong two sizes while every part of the machinery around it looked healthy.
// A preload with no matching face is a download the browser throws away.
//
// Generated from a table rather than written out, because the frozen tree's globals.css
// spelled all 21 faces by hand and the only thing that varied between them was three
// strings. Only the faces a page can actually use are emitted: the reading preset and the
// chrome font, six declarations, rather than every family the binary happens to carry.

 * The unicode ranges each subset covers, and the files are built to match them by

 * strings. A range the CSS claims and the file does not carry is a silent fallback face
 * for that one character, so the two have to be read together.
 *
 * Two sets, and the difference between them is now only in the Latin halves: the mono
 * families were sliced by a later version of Google's pipeline, so their latin drops
 * U+2074 and their latin-ext drops the ligature block. The vietnamese ranges USED to
 * differ too — see the note on that entry, which was a real bug rather than a slicing

/**
 * Metric-matched fallbacks: the local faces each stack falls back to, RESHAPED to the
 * self-hosted family's measurements, so the swap `font-display:swap` performs moves nothing.
 *
 * TWO PER FAMILY, AND THE SECOND IS NOT OPTIONAL. Georgia and Arial are the desktop answer
 * and for two months were the only one, so this table did nothing on ANDROID, where neither
 * exists: `local()` failed and the stack fell through to a bare `serif` with no adjustment.
 * Measured on the demo front page at 390px, 2026-08-28: during the swap window the document
 * stood 6,390px against 6,921px once Literata landed, so every block below the first sat
 * 531px too high and then dropped. Pixel-identical on a Mac, which is why it went unseen.
 * Android's `serif` is Noto Serif and its `sans-serif` Roboto, each with its OWN numbers —
 * one `size-adjust` cannot serve two local faces of different width.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE PLATFORM TEST: a device resolves the first name it has, so the desktop twin
 * leads and the Android twin catches what it misses.
 *
 * The four numbers are measured, not styled. `size-adjust` is the ratio of the two families'
 * average advance width over a mixed Vietnamese + English sample, read glyph by glyph from
 * the shipped woff2 subsets — NOT from `OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`, which averages bare a–z and
 * misreads a language whose vowels carry diacritics. The overrides are the family's typo
 * ascent/descent/line-gap over (upm x size-adjust).
 * `scripts/ops/font-fallback-metrics.py` recomputes all of it when a font file is re-dropped.
 *
 * Weight stays default in every row: the nearest weight always matches within a family, so
 * bold during the swap renders synthesized-bold at the right WIDTH — width is what keeps the
 * line breaks, and the line breaks are what keep the layout still. The mono families carry no
 * fallback on purpose: `unicode-range` downloads them only on pages with code, and a code
 * block's box, not its glyphs, sets that layout.
