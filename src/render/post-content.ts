// Ported from the frozen tree's `components/blog/PostContent.tsx`, and the transforms below
// are still byte-for-byte that port. WHAT CHANGED ON 2026-09-13 is the parser underneath them:
// `marked` drew this page for two years and `src/md/` draws it now (ADR 0052). The five things
// this site wants that no Markdown spec mentions used to live here as `marked` renderer
// overrides — a safe `href`, a demoted body `h1`, `scope="col"`, raw HTML as text, and a lone
// newline as a line break — and they are now `md/html-rules.ts`'s `PAGE`, asked for by name in
// `renderPostContent` below.
//
// The gate held: 45 of 45 golden fixtures and 89 of 92 of this blog's real posts paint
// identically, measured in a browser (`scripts/md-paint-diff.ts`). The three that moved are in
// the commit message, and all three are repairs.

/**
 * A wide table scrolls INSIDE ITS OWN BOX, and the article does not move.
 *
 * The scroll used to sit on `.prose` itself (`prose.css.ts`, `.prose:has(table){overflow-x:auto}`),
 * which fixed the phone bug it was written for and created a worse one everywhere else. CSS
 * gives no way to scroll one axis alone: an `overflow-x` that is not `visible` computes
 * `overflow-y` to `auto` as well, so an article carrying a single table became a scroll box
 * four thousand pixels tall. Measured on a live post: `clientHeight` 4119 against
 * `scrollHeight` 4120 — one pixel of overflow, and enough for Safari to draw a scrollbar down
 * the side of the reading column and take that width out of the text.
 *
 * The reason it was on `.prose` at all was that `overflow` is ignored on a `display:table`
 * box, and making the table `display:block` shrink-to-fits it (measured 607px down to 345px).
 * Both are true of the TABLE. Neither is true of a plain block wrapped around it, which is
 * what this adds: the table keeps `display:table` and its full width, and the box that
 * scrolls is one element rather than the whole piece.
 *
 * A string pass rather than a `renderer.table` override, so marked's own table HTML stays
 * byte-for-byte what it was and the golden diff is exactly this wrapper. GFM cannot nest a
 * table inside a table, so the non-greedy match cannot close on the wrong tag.
 *
 * ⚠️ `tabindex="0"` BECAUSE A BOX THAT SCROLLS AND CANNOT BE FOCUSED IS A MOUSE-ONLY BOX.
 * Measured at a 320px viewport: four of the six tables in the seed overflow their wrapper,
 * and the columns past the edge were reachable by dragging and by nothing else — no Tab
 * stop, so no arrow keys, so a keyboard or switch user could not read them at all. One
 * attribute makes the box a focus target and the arrow keys start working; it is what
 * `scrollable-region-focusable` asks for and it needs no script.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND NO `aria-label` WITH IT, which is the other half of the usual advice and is turned
 * down here on purpose. A name would have to be a word in the reader's language, and this
 * function renders the BODY — `renderPostContent` takes markdown and media facts, no
 * settings and no locale, and `bodyKey` is content-addressed over exactly those. Threading a
 * language in to label a wrapper would put the site's language into every cached body on the
 * blog. The house already answered this once: the paper look's "Table 1." labels are drawn by
 * CSS counters from a per-language stylesheet (`look-paper.css.ts`), not written into the
 * body. What a screen reader announces here is the table itself, headers and all.

 * and they are IN the key rather than invalidated out of it, which is the same trick the
 * highlighter already uses and needs no graph.
 *
 * The build commit is in the key too, so a deploy that changes any transform below cannot
