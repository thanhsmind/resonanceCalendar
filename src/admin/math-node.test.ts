// nothing threw, the post looked fine on screen, and the saved Markdown was a different
// document. Both regressions below were measured on the real extension set:
//
//     $$M \times V$$   ->   $$M \\times V$$      every backslash doubled
//     \(a_1 + b_2\)    ->   (a_1 + b_2)          delimiters eaten by markdown-it's escape rule
//
// happy-dom is registered for THIS FILE ONLY, the same rule `ink-mark.test.ts` follows:
// registering globally hands every other suite happy-dom's `fetch`.
