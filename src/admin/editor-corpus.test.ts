// THE EDITOR MEETS THE CORPUS, and the cross product it never had.
//
// Two blank-page bugs shipped on the same day, both in the editor's markdown-it rules:
//
//   **đậm** và ==mực==                      the nested parse shared the outer token array
//   [**@@Quire Ink@@**](https://…)          a silent claim that did not move the cursor
//
// Neither could have been found by the suites that existed, for structural reasons:
//
//   1. `golden/corpus/` holds 45 fixtures and only ONE of this repo's two parsers was ever run
//      against them. `marked` renders the reader's page and is gated by the golden compare;
//      markdown-it parses the WRITER'S page and saw none of it.
//   2. Every pen fixture tested one gesture in one sentence. The bugs live in COMBINATIONS —
//      a gesture after emphasis, a gesture inside a link label — which a suite of
//      single-gesture fixtures cannot reach however many it has.
//
// So this runs the corpus through the EDITOR, and generates the cross product of every gesture
// against every container the pen can find itself inside.
//
// THE LAW IS A FIXED POINT, not an exact string. Opening and saving may legitimately normalise,
// and pinning exact output makes this a transcript to rewrite whenever anything improves. What
// may never happen is a document that keeps changing every time it is opened — silent
// corruption on a timer — or a parse that throws, which is a white screen. Both are caught by:
// serialize twice, compare.
//
// ⚠️ AND A FIXED POINT IS NOT ENOUGH, which is the correction of 2026-08-30. That law sees a
// document that keeps CHANGING. It is blind to one that changes ONCE and then holds — which is
// what a serializer that deletes something actually does. Every footnote reference in this
// corpus was being rewritten `[^1]` → `\[^1\]` on the first save, and `\[^1\]` is a perfectly
// stable fixed point, so all six footnote fixtures passed this file while the feature was gone
// from the published page. Callouts, table column alignment and the blank line after a picture
// went the same way: 19 of these 45 fixtures published differently after ONE pass through the
// editor, and nothing here could say so.
//
// So there is a second law, and it is the one that matches the promise: RENDER BOTH AND
// COMPARE. What a save may not do is change the reader's page. That is a stricter test than
// comparing Markdown — a setext heading rewritten as `#` is the same page and passes — and it
// is the only one that could have caught any of the four.
//
// happy-dom is registered for THIS FILE ONLY, the rule every editor suite here follows.

/**
 * The fixtures whose PAGE is allowed to move, and what moves in each.
 *
 * Every one is a normalisation Markdown itself permits — none loses a feature, a word or a
 * link. The list is short on purpose: an entry here is a promise that somebody looked, so
 * adding one is a decision, and adding one to make a red check go away is the failure this file
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT WAS EIGHT ENTRIES AND IS NOW ONE (2026-09-13), and that is the whole argument for the
 * engine rather than any number in a benchmark. Seven fixtures stopped moving on the day
 * `tiptap-markdown` came out, each for a reason worth naming:
 *
 *   callout-unknown, lazy-continuation   a line break between two lines of a quote, dropped
 *   entities                             `&copy;` decoded on the way in and written back as ©
 *   dangerous-hrefs, dangerous-href-…    `[js](…)` saved as `\[js\](…)`, which the renderer
 *                                        then read as DISPLAY MATHS — a link published as a
 *                                        formula, on two fixtures
 *   reference-links                      the same bug on `[two][missing]`
 *   task-lists                           a tight checklist saved loose, a blank line per item
 *
 * Five of those seven were the SERIALIZER escaping both brackets, which is the bug that cost 19
 * of 45 fixtures in August and was repaired in `ReaderSyntax.ts` for the two shapes anybody had
 * noticed. The engine does not have it: `md/to-markdown.ts` escapes the opening bracket only.
 *
 * The shape of this list was copied from `render/golden.test.ts` on 2026-08-30 — group by
 * BEHAVIOUR, bound both counts, and pin the new answer on disk so an excused fixture is still
 * compared byte for byte, against what it renders AFTER a save rather than against what it
 * rendered before. An earlier cut asserted only that an excused fixture rendered SOMETHING,
 * which would have passed on a post collapsed to a single character.
