// THE CONTROLS THE BROWSER CANNOT MOVE ON ITS OWN.
//
// Most of the settings screen needs no JavaScript at all: a text field, a number, a textarea, a
// select and a checkbox all hold their own value, and `settings-form.ts` reads them straight off
// the DOM when it is time to save. What is here is the short list of controls that are NOT
// native form elements and therefore have to be told what they are:
//
//   · the SWITCH, which is a `<button role="switch">` because a switch draws no text of its own
//     and a `<label>` cannot name a `<button>`;
//   · the SEGMENTED CHOICE, which is a row of buttons carrying `aria-pressed`;
//   · the COLOUR, which is two inputs over one value and has to keep them in step;
//   · the SLIDER's readout;
//   · the GATE and the CURTAIN, which show a row that depends on another row's answer.
//
// Every one of them ships drawn in the state the server could see. Nothing here builds a row.
