// THE MARKDOWN SOURCE VIEW, and the switch between it and the writing.
//
// Everything here is about the OTHER view of the same document: which one is showing, the text
// the textarea holds, and the arithmetic that turns a caret in one into a caret in the other.
// Nothing here knows about the toolbar, the menus or the pen.
//
// ⚠️ BOTH VIEWS ARE IN THE PAGE AT ONCE, and only one is `hidden`. The React version rendered
// the paper conditionally, so switching to the source REMOVED the host the writing surface
// lived in — and switching back built a new one, which is how an editor shipped that came back
// from the Markdown view showing an empty sheet with the document intact inside it. A `hidden`
// attribute cannot do that: the surface stays exactly where it was mounted.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THE SWITCH USED TO LOSE, and it was two separate losses. The scroll box kept its
// PIXEL offset while the two views have different heights, so 85% of the way down the writing
// arrived as 66% of the way down the source; and the textarea opened with its caret at 0, so
// the first click in it scrolled the piece to the top. Measured 2026-09-13 on an 18k-word
// draft: from three different starting points, every switch ended at offset 0.
