// Three pieces of chrome that are not in the sheet's markup, because none of them belongs to
// it: the button strip is the editor's own row of commands, the bubble bar is positioned by a
// ProseMirror plugin, and the "/" menu is `position: fixed` at coordinates the editor measured
// when the key was pressed. ADR 0054's third decision is the line this file sits on — the page
// arrives as HTML, and the APPLICATION inside it builds its own furniture.
//
// The button strip is mounted and unmounted rather than hidden, and that is not a lapse from
// the one-DOM rule: it is STICKY and takes space at the top of the sheet, so the Markdown view
// and focus mode both want it gone rather than invisible.
