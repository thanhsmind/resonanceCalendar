// THE IMPORTER: a file in, and then the images it left behind on somebody else's server.
//
// ⚠️ THE CARD WAS MARKUP AND NOTHING ELSE UNTIL 2026-09-15. ADR 0054 drew it — the hidden file
// input, the Choose key, the filename slot, the Import key with its three labels — and the
// island was never written. `docs/spec/07-parity-admin.md` §15 lists WordPress import as a
// shipped feature; what an owner actually had was a card that looked operable, a Choose key
// that opened nothing, and a Run key that shipped `disabled` and was never armed.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS THE ONE CONTROL ON THE SETTINGS SCREEN THAT BULK-WRITES CONTENT, and nothing on
// either side of it is idempotent. `ops.ts` never overwrites: a second run of the same file
// writes `hello-2`, `about-2` and so on, reports a perfectly successful import, and — because
// a multi-segment WordPress path is not caught by the live-content guard in `server/redirects.ts`
// — repoints the old-URL redirect at the DUPLICATE. Every inbound link then lands on the copy.
// The server has no rate limit, no lock and no dedupe on `/api/import/*`, so the only thing
// standing between an impatient second press and two copies of a blog is the `disabled`
// attribute this file maintains. That is why it is set before the request and restored in a
// `finally`, and why the file is cleared on success.
//
// ⚠️ NO RELOAD WHEN IT IS DONE. The React card called `router.refresh()`; the obvious port is
// `location.reload()`, and on THIS screen that is wrong — `settings-save.ts` holds a
// `beforeunload` guard and a leave-question for a dirty form, so a reload mid-import either
// raises the browser's own warning or throws away unsaved edits across seven tabs. The toast
// says what landed; the lists are a navigation away.
