// Arrange mode: the rail's rows, picked up and put down somewhere else.
//
// Its own file, and loaded only on the way IN — a dynamic import from `rail.ts`, so a rail
// nobody is rearranging costs nothing for this. That is also why the mode is the one place the
// island adds elements: the grip and two steppers on eighteen rows would be ~14 KB of SVG in
// every page for something entered twice a year.
//
// IT ADDS NO MARKUP OF ITS OWN. The wrapper is a `<template>` the server put in the page, the
// footer's labelled rows and the two switches are drawn there too and merely unhidden. This
// file moves nodes and writes attributes; what a row looks like stays one file's business.
//
// TWO WAYS TO MOVE A ROW, and the second is not a courtesy. A drag is a pointer event on every
// browser that has one and does not exist on a touch screen at all — an iPad in landscape is
// 1024px wide, which is exactly where this rail appears, so a drag-only editor would ship a
// feature that cannot be used on the device most likely to want it. The steppers are that
// answer, and they are the keyboard's too: a row can be moved with Tab and Return.
//
// EVERY MOVE IS SAVED, immediately. The alternative is a Save button on a rail, and a rail is
// where you go to leave the screen — an arrangement that only survives if you remember to press
// something is an arrangement that gets lost by the second click.
