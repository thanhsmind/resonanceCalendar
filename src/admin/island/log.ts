// The log screen's three controls, over rows the server already sent (ADR 0054, step 1).
//
// It filters and it pages. It does not BUILD anything, and it does not know what a row looks
// like: every line of the ledger is in the markup, carrying the three facts a filter asks about
// (`data-kind`, `data-at`, `data-find`), and this hides the ones that do not match.
//
// WHY THE HAYSTACK IS PRE-FOLDED. `data-find` is the sentence, the detail and the machine code
// with accents already stripped, written once by the server. A keystroke is then one
// `includes` per row instead of folding two hundred strings — which matters because somebody
// looking for a post types its title, and the search has to answer while they are still typing.
//
// The same shape as the rail: the DOM does not change, an attribute does.
