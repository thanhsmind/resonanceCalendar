// The admin rail's behaviour, in plain TypeScript (ADR 0054).
//
// The rail's MARKUP arrives with the page (`web/admin/rail.ts`). This is everything that
// happens to it afterwards, and it is deliberately small: the rail is one DOM whatever state
// it is in, so almost every control here sets an attribute on `<html>` and lets CSS do the
// work. Nothing is rebuilt, which is why nothing here can rebuild it wrongly.
//
// The one exception is arrange mode, which really does add elements, and it is in its own
// file: `rail-arrange.ts`, loaded the moment somebody enters the mode and never before.
//
// WHY NOT REACT. It was 803 lines across three components and six more they pulled in, and it
// could not draw until a bundle had been fetched, parsed and run. The rail is the frame the
// owner navigates by; it should be there in the first frame, and now it is.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO: know what a row looks like. Every class, every label and every
// glyph is the server's, and a style written here would be a second opinion about the rail
// that only one of the two could win.
