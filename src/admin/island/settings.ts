// The settings screen's behaviour (ADR 0054): seven tabs, one Save, and the way past them.
//
// EVERY CONTROL ON ALL SEVEN TABS ARRIVED AS MARKUP, and so did all 113 rows of the search.
// This file moves the five controls a browser cannot move on its own (`lib/settings-controls`),
// counts what has changed and stores it (`lib/settings-save`), swaps which panel is on screen,
// and narrows a list that is already there. It builds nothing.
//
// ⚠️ ALL SEVEN PANELS ARE IN THE PAGE AT ONCE, which is not the newsletter's three tabs written
// larger: the Save key stores the WHOLE form. An owner changes the blog's name on one tab, the
// front page's shape on another and a palette on a third, and presses Save once. Drawing one tab
// and navigating between them would make every switch a page load, and a page load with unsaved
// work either loses it or raises the browser's own warning.
