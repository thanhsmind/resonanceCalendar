// KEEPING THE PLACE across the switch between the writing and the Markdown source.
//
// The two functions under test are each other's inverse, and the law that makes them useful
// is a ROUND TRIP: a caret somewhere in the document, expressed as an offset in the Markdown
// and read back, has to come home to the same sentence. Pinning exact positions instead would
// pin the serializer's notation — a fixture to rewrite whenever a mark's syntax changes —
// while saying nothing about the property the writer actually feels.
//
// The corpus is run through it because the failure this replaces was invisible on a short
// document: the old switch kept a PIXEL offset, which is right at the top of a piece and
// wrong by a screenful near the bottom of a long one.
//
// happy-dom is registered for THIS FILE ONLY, the rule every editor suite here follows.
