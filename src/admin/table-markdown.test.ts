// The table, opened and saved.
//
// Three ways a table used to lose its contents on a SAVE — not on an edit, on a save, which
// means the writer does nothing wrong and finds out later. All three came out of one run of
// `editor-corpus.test.ts` on the day it was written. A fourth, older one is below them: any
// table GFM could not express was replaced whole by the literal text `[table]`.
// `components/TableMarkdown.ts` holds the fixes and the reasoning.
//
// The law each of these asserts is the same one that suite asserts: opening and saving must
// be a FIXED POINT. A table that loses a column per save is the worst kind of bug this editor
// can have, because every save looks like it worked.
