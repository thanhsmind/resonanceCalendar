// Editor node for an embedded video. Stored in Markdown as a bare URL on its own line (so the
// content stays 100% Markdown); shown here as a responsive embed. The public renderer turns the
// same URL into an iframe.
//
// ⚠️ A PLAIN PROSEMIRROR NODE VIEW, not a React one (ADR 0054 step 5, first half). What that
// buys is not tidiness: a node view is the one piece of the editor that runs INSIDE the
// document, so while it is a React component every document this admin can open is a document
// React has to be mounted to draw. Nothing here needed React — there was no state, no effect
// and no ref, only JSX.
//
// ⚠️ ITS WORDS ARRIVE THROUGH `configure()`, because a node view has no context to read them
// from. `useAdminT()` was a React hook; the alternative to passing them in would be an island
// importing all eleven dictionaries to print two labels.
