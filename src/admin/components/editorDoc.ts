// Three things done TO a Tiptap document, with no React anywhere near them.
//
// Lifted out of `Editor.tsx` on 2026-09-13, when the find strip needed five lines in a file
// already sitting one line under its ceiling. The seam is not arithmetic: each of these takes
// an editor and answers a question about the document, and none of them has ever needed a
// hook, a prop or a piece of state. `editorExtensions.ts` came out of the same file for the
// same reason and the split held.

/**
 * WHERE THE CARET IS, said in the other view's units — so switching between the writing and
 * the Markdown source lands on the line the writer was in the middle of.
 *
 * Both directions rest on ONE property, checked rather than assumed: serializing the
 * document CUT at a position produces exactly the prefix that serializing the whole document
 * produces. It holds because the serializer walks the tree in order and never looks ahead,
 * and it means a length is an offset — no mapping table, no matching on the text.
 *
 * Without this the switch lost the place twice over. The scroll box kept its PIXEL offset
 * while the two views have different heights, so 85% of the way down the writing became 66%
 * of the way down the source; and the textarea opened with its caret at 0, so the moment it
 * was clicked to carry on typing the browser scrolled to the caret and the whole piece
 * jumped to the top. Measured 2026-09-13 on an 18k-word draft: from every one of three
 * starting points, the first click in the source view went to offset 0.

 * The reverse, by NEWTON'S METHOD rather than a binary search, because the two lengths are
 * very nearly proportional — Markdown is the text plus its notation — so one step of
 * interpolation lands close and the next two land on it. A binary search over the same range
 * would be a dozen serializes of half a document; this is three of them, and it stops early
 * when a step changes nothing.
 *
 * `THRESHOLD` is in Markdown characters: closer than a short word is closer than a reader can
 * see, and chasing the last few characters costs a whole serialize each.
