// What the editor does when the pen lands (ADR 0049): the mark just applied draws itself
// across the words, and the felt tip squeaks.
//
// The same seam as `key-feedback.ts`, and it matters for the same reason: everything here
// stays OUTSIDE ProseMirror's document. A transaction that adds a pen mark is noticed after
// the fact, the DOM elements it produced get a class for a beat, and the class is what the
// stylesheet animates. No attribute in the document, nothing serialised, nothing that a
// later transaction has to know about — and if ProseMirror redraws the node before the beat
// is over, the class goes with it and nothing is the worse.
//
// Only a mark being APPLIED. Opening a document full of marks, typing inside one, moving
// the caret through one: none of those add a mark step, so none of them sweep. The rule the
// key feedback lives by holds here too — the words never move; only the ink under them is
// arriving.
