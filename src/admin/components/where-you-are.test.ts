// Settings screen that put "Site" — the section you are in — eight lines above "English" — a
// field's current value — in the same ink, size and shape, with nothing saying which of the
// two was answering "where am I". A screen where everything is the same rectangle has told
// you nothing by the time you have looked at all of it, and that sameness is most of what
// made the admin read as stiff and mechanical.
//
// So the ink carries a meaning and the meaning is the thing worth defending: a second colour
// that means ONE thing is a signal, and a palette is not. The day someone highlights a
// selected value too, the signal is gone and no screenshot review will catch it — it will
// look livelier, which is the trap.
