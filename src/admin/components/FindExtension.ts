// two things that cannot be done in a string: it turns the document into text WITH the
// positions to get back, and it draws the hits without touching the document.
//
// DECORATIONS, NOT MARKS, and that distinction is the whole design. A mark would be an edit:
// it would go in the undo history, it would be serialised into the Markdown the piece saves
// as, and clearing it would be a second edit. A decoration is a drawing instruction held
// beside the document — nothing about the piece changes while a writer is looking through it,
// which is what "find" has to mean in an editor whose save contract is that a save may not
// change the reader's page.
