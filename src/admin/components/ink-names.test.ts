// The five highlighter swatches have five different names.
//
// They shipped with one. Every button carried `title={t.tbHighlight}` and nothing else: no
// text, no `aria-label`, five controls with one identical accessible name, told apart only
// by an inline background colour on the span inside them. Anything not reading colour — a
// screen reader, and anyone who cannot separate those five hues — was offered five buttons
// it had no way to choose between. Found by listing the bubble bar's accessible names in a
// browser and seeing "Highlighter" five times.
//
// The names already existed in all eleven languages, because the settings screen has always
// labelled the same five pickers. This asserts the lookup that reaches them still resolves
// for every ink and every language, which is the part that can rot: `INKS` is a list in the
// renderer and the strings are keys in `locales/`, and nothing but this connects them.
