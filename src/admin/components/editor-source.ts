// The markdown source view: a textarea you type in, over a mirror that dims the syntax.
//
// WHY A MIRROR. A `<textarea>` renders one uniform run of text and nothing can style a part
// of it — there is no way to reach `##` or `---` from CSS. So the text is drawn twice: a
// `<pre>` underneath holding the same characters with the markers wrapped, and the textarea
// on top with its own text made transparent. The reader sees the mirror; the caret,
// selection, undo, spellcheck and every keystroke belong to the textarea, which stays the
// only source of truth. If `mark()` below ever threw, the words would still be there — the
// mirror is decorative and `aria-hidden`.
//
// THE TWO BOXES MUST MEASURE IDENTICALLY or the caret drifts from the glyph it is sitting
// after. That is why neither element carries its own metrics here: `.md-box` in `admin.css`
// sets the font, size, leading, padding, wrapping and tab size for both, and there is no
// second place to change one of them in.
//
// NO SCROLL SYNC, and that is not an oversight. `wireRaw` in `island/lib/sheet-raw.ts` grows
// the textarea to its own `scrollHeight` every time it reveals this view, and `className.source`
// below keeps `overflow-hidden` on it, so the box never scrolls internally: the page does. A
// mirror pinned to the same box therefore cannot drift. If that autogrow is ever removed,
// this needs an `onScroll` that copies `scrollTop`/`scrollLeft`, and the caret will visibly
// separate from the text until it does.
//
// ⚠️ PLAIN TYPESCRIPT (ADR 0054 step 5). `mark` and `withHits` were always pure and are
// unchanged; what left React is the pair of elements around them.

/**
 * The INLINE markers, in one pass.
 *
 * One combined expression rather than a chain of `.replace()` calls, because a chain runs the
 * second pattern over HTML the first produced — and `<i>` contains no marker characters only by
 * luck. `String.replace` scans the ORIGINAL string, so a single alternation cannot re-enter its
 * own output. It also settles precedence for free: a code span is listed first, so the asterisks
 * inside `` `a * b` `` are never reached by the emphasis rule. Applied to already-escaped text,
 * which is safe because every character these rules match is ASCII punctuation.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO BACKREFERENCES, and the first draft is why. Written as `(\*\*|__)(...)\1`, the `\1`
 * looks local and is not: inside a combined alternation the number is ABSOLUTE, so it pointed at
 * the code span's backticks eleven groups earlier. In this branch that group never participates,
 * an unmatched backreference matches the empty string, and the pattern quietly became "`**`,
 * then the shortest run ending in a non-space" — which is why `**Spacing**` came out as
 * `**S**pacing**`. Maths and strikethrough had the same bug.
 *
 * So each rule closes itself, and the rules OWN their group offsets: `RULES` is walked to build
 * both the expression and the index of where each one's groups start, so inserting a rule in
 * the middle cannot silently renumber the ones after it.
