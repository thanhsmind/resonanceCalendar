// What the editor does when a key lands: an overlay caret, and a click made on the spot.
//
// Was `typewriter.ts`, split from Editor.tsx at the 400-line cap. Renamed on 2026-08-24 when
// the one switch became a choice of instrument — typewriter, tactile, linear, off — because
// a file called `typewriter` cannot honestly hold a linear switch. The seam is unchanged and
// still clean: everything here stays OUTSIDE ProseMirror's document, so there are no
// character wrappers, no document mutations and no selection changes.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS NOT HERE ANY MORE, and it is the important part. Every keystroke used to
// animate the whole BLOCK — `opacity: 0.9 → 1` and a 0.6px nudge on the paragraph being
// typed into. At sixty words a minute that is a paragraph strobing five times a second
// under the reader's eyes, and the owner's word for it was "nháy". Nothing that moves the
// TEXT survives: the sound carries the keystroke, the caret carries the position, and the
// words hold still. On a real machine the paper moves and the words do not.

/**
 * How long the caret holds still after the last keystroke before it starts blinking again.

 * second flicker competing with the first. Every editor worth using stops it while the
 * hands are moving — the blink says "the cursor is here and nothing is happening", and
 * something IS happening. 700ms is about a beat and a half of ordinary typing, so a fast
 * writer never sees it blink at all and a pause of any length does.
