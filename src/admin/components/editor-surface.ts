// WHAT THE WRITING SURFACE DOES WITH A POINTER, A KEY, A DROP AND A PASTE.
//
// Its own file because it is the half of the editor that answers the HAND, and because
// `Editor.tsx` reached the 400-line cap the day the React adapter left it. Everything here is
// a ProseMirror `editorProps` handler: it runs inside the view, sees raw DOM events, and knows
// nothing about React.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY DEPENDENCY ARRIVES AS A REF OR A SETTER, never as a captured value. These closures
// are built ONCE, when the editor is constructed and before the instance exists; reading the
// live editor through `editorRef` instead of a captured const is what makes a dropped image
// land reliably, rather than only when the stale closure happened to hold a non-null editor.
//
// A `Holder` and not `React.RefObject`: the shape is the same one-property box, and naming
// React here would be the last thing in this file that knows the caller's framework.
