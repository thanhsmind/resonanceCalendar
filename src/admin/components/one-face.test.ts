// The admin is set in ONE face, and the one place that is not is the editor.
//
// This file was `two-faces.test.ts` and it guarded the opposite rule. Both rules came from the
// owner eight days apart — two faces on 2026-08-14, one face on 2026-08-15, with the editor
// keeping the face the frontend publishes in — and the file is rewritten rather than deleted
// because the FAILURE
// MODES it was built around are unchanged. Whichever rule is in force, the way it breaks is
// that a primitive and a screen disagree about which face a thing wears, and nothing goes red.
//
// The old file's finding, kept because it is the reason these assertions are in code rather
// than in a stylesheet: `Setting` renders its hint as a `<p>` and `ui/Input` renders the
// IDENTICAL hint as a `<span>`, so a `.admin p` rule put two hints of one kind, on one card,
// four lines apart, in two different faces — with both call sites correct. A tag is not a role.
// Under one face that particular bug cannot happen, and the mirror of it can: a screen that
// still carries `READING` keeps a second face alive on a surface that should have lost it.
