// WHICH OF THE FORTY PENS THE WRITER SEES.
//
// The published page deals every stroke a variant of its own: `md/html.ts` hashes the
// gesture's Markdown source (`pen/grammar.ts`, `penSeed`) into `data-pen="0".."79"`, and the
// forty grips and their dies in `pen/ink.css.ts` make one hand that never repeats itself.
//
// The editor had none of it. Nothing in `src/admin` ever wrote `data-pen` — the attribute
// does not exist in the whole history of this directory — so every stroke in the writing
// surface fell back to the four `var(--x, default)` values at the foot of `ink.css.ts`: ONE
// pen, forty times, while the page under the same words dealt forty. Found on 2026-09-14 by
// the underline sitting through the middle of the letters in the editor and at their feet on
// the page; the fallback was the cause of both.
//
// ⚠️ THE SEED IS A VIEW CONCERN, NOT A DOCUMENT ONE, and that is the whole shape of this
// file. Putting the number in the mark's attributes would have been shorter and is wrong
// twice over: ProseMirror compares marks BY their attributes, so two neighbouring strokes
// dealt different pens would stop being one mark and save as `==a====b==` — which reads back
// as a single stroke over `a====b`, losing a gesture in silence. And `from-editor.ts` groups
// runs by `JSON.stringify(attrs)`, so the same difference would re-cut every run. The page
// does not store the number either; it computes it at render time from the source. This does
// the same thing, against the DOM, at draw time.
//
// The same seam `pen-feedback.ts` sits on, for the same reason (ADR 0049): nothing here is a
// transaction, nothing is in the undo history, and a save cannot see it.

/**
 * A drawn stroke read back as the Markdown it came from, because that is what is hashed.
 *
 * `penSeed` takes the gesture's SOURCE, fences and colour suffix and all, so `==a==` and the
 * word `a` are different pens. The three fences and the `#colour` rule are the same ones
 * `to-markdown.ts` writes with, and the attributes are the ones the marks render: no
 * `data-ink` means yellow for a highlight and graphite or red for the two line gestures, and
 * in all three cases the source carries no suffix either.
 *
 * ONE SHAPE DIFFERS FROM THE PAGE, on purpose: a stroke drawn across emphasis, a link, code
 * or a formula hashes here from the WORDS (`==a b c==`) and on the page from the SOURCE
 * (`==a **b** c==`), because the element holds text and the engine holds Markdown. Such a
 * stroke is dealt a DIFFERENT one of the forty rather than a wrong one — the grip changes,
 * the gesture does not — and the exact answer would mean serializing a slice of the document
 * on every draw, in the one loop this editor has already been bitten for the cost of.
 *
 * Measured on the live pages 2026-09-14, parsed rather than pattern-matched: 171 strokes
 * across 120 pages, 6 of them carrying markup, all six in one post. So 165 agree exactly.
