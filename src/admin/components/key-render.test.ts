// The three instruments, held apart by measurement.
//
// This suite exists because of a verdict on 2026-08-25: the three sounds were not different
// from one another. That was right, and nothing in 1849 tests had any opinion about it — the
// three "instruments" were one noise generator with three centre frequencies, 1840 / 1144 /
// 972 Hz apart, which is not three keyboards. A sound is not a matter of taste that code
// cannot check: where its energy sits, how long it lives and how many times something
// happens are all numbers.
//
// So: if somebody retunes a voice until the three converge again, this goes red.
