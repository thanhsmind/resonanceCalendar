// The three instruments, described as the machines they are.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Until 2026-08-25 the three "instruments" were ONE
// generator — a burst of white noise through one bandpass — with three centre frequencies.
// That is not three keyboards, it is one sound with three EQ settings, and it was heard
// immediately as three sounds that did not differ. A tactile switch and a typewriter do not
// differ by a filter frequency. They differ by what physically happens, how many times, and
// how far apart, so that is what is written down here.
//
// A strike is a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. Each event is some filtered noise (contact, air, the
// scrape of one part against another) and/or some decaying sinusoids (a body that was struck
// and is now ringing). Timing carries most of the character: the ear reads two transients
// 14ms apart as one crisp event and two 55ms apart as two.

/** A struck body ringing: one mode of it, decaying exponentially. */

   * and a knock. What is left is the case ringing low and letting go slowly.
