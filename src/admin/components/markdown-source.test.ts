// What the markdown source view dims, and what it must leave alone.
//
// `mark()` writes HTML that is inserted with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, so two of these are
// security tests rather than appearance ones: the escaping, and the fact that no rule can
// introduce a tag the writer did not type.
//
// The rest exist because the first draft shipped a defect that a screenshot caught and no
// assertion would have: a backreference inside a combined alternation is ABSOLUTE, so `\1`
// in the eleventh rule pointed at the first rule's group, matched empty, and turned
// `**Spacing**` into `**S**pacing**`. Every paired rule is checked here for that reason.
