 * A-weighted against the generator it replaces, a letter at the top of the slider is about
 * SEVEN TIMES the amplitude of the old one at ITS top, and the old default was half of that
 * again. A ceiling only twice as loud as a level somebody calls too quiet is the wrong
 * ceiling.
 *
 * The taper is LINEAR on purpose. The usual argument for a curve is that loudness is
 * logarithmic and a linear slider crowds everything into the bottom third — true of a
 * sustained tone across a 60 dB range, and this is a click on a 25 dB range. Measured over

 * something:
 *
 *  - **The ear.** A-weighting (IEC 61672) is the standard answer to how much a human cares
 *    about energy at a given frequency. It says a 2.2 kHz crack lands in the most sensitive
 *    octave there is, and a 220 Hz thock lands where the ear gives away a great deal:
 *    1.00 / 2.53 / 0.58.
 *  - **The speaker.** The owner writes on a laptop, whose driver is a sealed 20mm cone that
 *    is down hard below its resonance. Modelled as a second-order high-pass at 250 Hz on top
 *    of the ear, the answer moves a long way: 1.00 / 1.89 / 0.79 — the typewriter loses low
 *    end too, so the crack needs less lift and the thock needs more.
 *
 * The geometric mean of the two is what ships. Matching the three on PEAK AMPLITUDE instead,
 * which is what looks reasonable in code, is how the thock ends up inaudible and the crack
 * ends up painful. Re-measure with the same method if a voice is retuned; do not nudge these
 * by eye.
