// THE BAR THAT FOLLOWS THE SELECTION (ADR 0054 step 7).
//
// Select a phrase and a small strip appears above it with the emphasis keys on it. This was
// `@tiptap/extension-bubble-menu`, which is a wrapper around `floating-ui` — a general
// positioning engine with middleware, collision detection against arbitrary boundaries, and an
// autoUpdate loop. What this product asks of it is: above the selection, centred, flipped below
// when the top of the sheet is in the way.
//
// ⚠️ `coordsAtPos` IS THE WHOLE OF IT. ProseMirror answers where a document position is on the
// screen, in viewport coordinates, and the bar is `position: fixed`, so there is no offset
// parent to compensate for and no scroll to subtract. Everything below is arithmetic on two
// rectangles.
