// THE HAND-WRITTEN SCHEMA AGAINST THE ONE IT REPLACED, field by field.
//
// ⚠️ THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS COMPARISON IS A RECORDED FILE, AND IT MUST NEVER BE REGENERATED.
// `golden/editor/schema-before-step-7.json` is the schema `@tiptap/starter-kit` and seven other
// packages produced, captured from a worktree at `main` on 2026-09-15 — the last commit where
// those packages were installed. Regenerating it from the schema it guards would turn a guard
// into a copy of the thing it is guarding, which is a mistake this repository has already paid
// for (`golden/v1/corpus/` carries the same warning, for the same reason).
//
// While both existed, this file compared against a RUNNING Tiptap editor and 310 assertions
// passed. What it does now is hold the answer: a change to any node, any mark, any attribute
// default or any `toDOM` shows up here as a diff somebody has to accept on purpose.
//
// WHAT IT COMPARES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Names, content expressions, groups, the flags that
// decide how a key behaves, attribute names with their defaults, the `toDOM` of everything, the
// mark ORDER (which is the nesting order a save writes), and which marks each one excludes. Not
// `parseDOM`, which has no comparable shape between the two and is exercised by pasting.
//
// ⚠️ THREE DIFFERENCES ARE DELIBERATE and are asserted AS differences below, so that this file
// says what changed rather than hiding it in a tolerance.
//
// happy-dom is registered for this file only, the rule every editor suite here follows.
