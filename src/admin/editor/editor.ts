// THE EDITOR THE REST OF THE ADMIN TALKS TO (ADR 0054 step 7).
//
// A `ProseMirror.EditorView` with a schema, a plugin stack and a vocabulary — and a surface that
// is deliberately the one the chrome already used. `editor.chain().focus().toggleBold().run()`
// is written in thirty-one places; `editor.isActive('heading', { level: 2 })` in fourteen. Those
// are the product's own words for what its buttons do. Keeping them is what let the layer
// underneath be replaced without touching a single call site, and it is the reason the diff for
// this step is a new directory rather than a rewrite of the toolbar.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IT IS NOT IS A REIMPLEMENTATION OF THE WRAPPER. There is no extension system, no
// priority number, no per-extension storage, no `configure`. The plugin stack is a list in
// `plugins.ts`, the schema is a file, and the commands are a table. A name that is not in that
// table cannot be called, which is the point.
