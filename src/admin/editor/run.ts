// HOW SEVERAL COMMANDS BECOME ONE EDIT (ADR 0054 step 7).
//
// A ProseMirror command is `(state, dispatch?) => boolean`: it asks the state whether it can do
// the thing, and if it is given a `dispatch` it does it. That is the whole contract, and it is
// enough for one command at a time.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THREE, AND THAT IS WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The toolbar asks for
// "focus, then extend the selection over the link, then unset it" — and running those as three
// commands means three transactions: three trips through every plugin, three redraws, and
// THREE ENTRIES IN THE UNDO HISTORY, so one press of the Bold key would need three presses of
// Mod-Z to take back. The product's own call sites already say `chain().focus().toggleBold()`,
// in thirty-one places, because the wrapper that is leaving offered exactly this.
//
// So a chain accumulates into ONE transaction. Each command is run against a state that reports
// the document and the selection AS THE TRANSACTION HAS THEM SO FAR — a later command in the
// chain sees what the earlier one did — while `state.tr` hands back the SAME transaction rather
// than a fresh one. That is the trick, and it is the only unusual thing here.
//
// ⚠️ A CHAIN IS ALL OR NOTHING. A command that answers `false` stops the rest and the
// transaction is never dispatched, because half of "wrap this in a link and set its href" is
// worse than none of it.
