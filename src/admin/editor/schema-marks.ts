// THE EIGHT MARKS, written out, because this product owns its own schema now (ADR 0054 step 7).
//
// Every one of these came from a package until 2026-09-15: five from `@tiptap/starter-kit` and
// three from this repo's own extensions, which had to be expressed as Tiptap `Mark.create` calls
// to sit beside them. A `MarkSpec` is the thing ProseMirror actually wants, and it is shorter
// than the wrapper that produced it.
//
// ⚠️ THE ORDER IN THIS FILE IS THE NESTING ORDER, and it is not cosmetic. ProseMirror ranks
// marks by their position in the schema's map and `Mark.sort()` uses that rank, so the order
// here decides whether the serializer writes `==**bold**==` or `**==bold==**` for the same
// document. It is the order the previous schema ended up with — link, bold, code, italic,
// strike, underline, ink, ring — which Tiptap arrived at by sorting on a `priority` number
// spread across eight files. One list is the same answer, written where it can be read.

// ⚠️ `excludes` IS NARROWER THAN IT WAS, and that is a fix rather than a liberty.
//
// StarterKit's `code` is `excludes: '_'` — it refuses to share a character with ANY other mark
// — and `InkMark.ts` carried a paragraph explaining that a highlight running across an inline
// code span could not be held by the editor because of it, and could not be changed from
// outside: "the fix is a direct dependency on `@tiptap/extension-code` plus a forked mark".
// The mark is written here now, so the fix is a list instead of an underscore.
//
// The server has always rendered ``==a `b` c==`` as one unbroken stroke. Opening and saving
// used to end the stroke before the code, which is a save that changes the reader's page — the
// one thing `editor-corpus.test.ts`'s second law exists to forbid.
//
// ⚠️ `_` IS NOT A LIST YOU CAN SUBTRACT FROM. It is ProseMirror's word for "every mark", and
// `'_ ink'` still means every mark — the first term already said all of them. So the marks this
// one excludes are NAMED, and the three pen gestures are the omission. `schema-agreement.test.ts`
// walks every mark in the schema and asserts which side of that line it falls on, so a ninth
// mark added later cannot quietly become legal inside a code span.
