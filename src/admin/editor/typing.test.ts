// ⚠️ THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE 3,572 TESTS AND 167 BROWSER FLOWS COULD NOT SEE ANY OF IT. They
// open a document and save it, and they were right about that: 116 real posts open and save
// byte-identically through this editor and the one it replaced. Every defect below was in the
// gap between those two acts — the keystroke. A writer typing `- [ ] buy milk` got
// `- [ ] \[ ]` and a stray paragraph; typing a URL lost the space after it and the last
// character of the address; typing `---` and carrying on destroyed the rule and four of the
// five characters. None of it touched a saved file, so none of it was visible to anything.
//
// The cases here are not invented: each one was run against the outgoing build too, and the
// answer recorded is the answer that build gave — except where it is marked as a deliberate
// improvement on it, which is three of them.
//
// happy-dom is registered for this file only, the rule every editor suite here follows.
