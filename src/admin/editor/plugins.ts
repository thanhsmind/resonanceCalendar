// THE PLUGIN STACK (ADR 0054 step 7).
//
// ⚠️ TWELVE PLUGINS, WHERE THERE WERE 102. Each package's extension contributed its own keymap
// plugin and its own input-rules plugin, and every keystroke walked the lot. What they were
// doing is here, in the order the view consults them.
//
// The order is not arbitrary: the keymap comes before the input rules so a chord is never eaten
// by a typing rule, the table's own plugin sits above the base keymap so Tab means "next cell"
// inside one, and the history is last so that everything above it has already turned a keystroke
// into the transaction it will be asked to remember.

 * AN EMPTY PARAGRAPH AT THE END, ALWAYS.

 * ⚠️ WITHOUT IT A PIECE THAT ENDS IN A TABLE OR A PICTURE HAS NOWHERE TO CLICK. There is no

 * put the caret in the last cell and press the right keys — which a writer will not do, and
 * will read as the editor refusing to let them continue.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT MUST NOT REACH THE FILE. `md/from-editor.ts` drops an empty paragraph, so the
 * trailing one is invisible to a save; `editor-corpus.test.ts`'s first law — serialize twice,
 * compare — is what holds that, because a paragraph that DID serialize would make every
 * document grow by a blank line on every open.
 *
 * ⚠️ `appendTransaction` DOES NOT RUN AT LOAD, which the word ALWAYS above used to promise and
 * did not deliver. `EditorState.create` never consults it — only `applyTransaction` does — so a
 * post that ends in a table opened with nothing under it and grew the paragraph later, as a
 * jump, on the first click. The outgoing build had exactly the same hole. `trailingOf` below is
 * what the editor calls when it builds its first document, so the promise is kept from the
 * first frame.
