// Pasting a Markdown article into the writing surface.
//
// The bug this guards shipped and was found by the owner, not by a test: paste a post's
// Markdown and every line landed as literal text — `# Heading` stayed two characters and a
// word, the table a wall of pipes. It did not stop there. The serializer escapes what it is
// handed, so SAVING that draft wrote `\# Dùng Synology…` and ```` \`\`\`bash ```` into the
// database, and the post published as its own source. The editor looked broken; what was
// broken was the document.
//
// The seam is `clipboardTextParser`, where prosemirror-view asks whether anyone can turn the
// clipboard's PLAIN TEXT into a slice. `tiptap-markdown` answers only when
// `transformPastedText` is on, and its default is off — one option, and the whole difference
// between pasting an article and pasting a screenshot of one.
//
// ⚠️ NOT `view.pasteText()`, which would be one line: it passes `preferPlain: true`, the flag
// meaning "the writer held Shift". The parser is contractually required to decline that, so
// the convenient helper tests the one path where the fix must NOT apply and reports green with
// the option switched back off. This goes through the prop itself.
//
// happy-dom is registered for THIS FILE ONLY: registering globally hands the rest of the run
// happy-dom's `fetch`.
