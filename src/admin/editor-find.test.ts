// change the reader's page (`docs/admin-editor.md`), and a find box is the feature most able
// to break it quietly: highlighting is drawn ON the text, so an implementation that reaches
// for a mark instead of a decoration serialises its own highlighter into the piece and the
// writer finds out when the post publishes with `==Gogh==` in it.
