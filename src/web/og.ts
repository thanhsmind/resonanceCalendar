// Everything comes from the query string, so the route reads no settings and touches no

//
// SSRF is the whole risk here. `?bg=` and `?font=` are attacker-controlled URLs that the
// SERVER fetches, so both are restricted to this site's own origin. Without that, a public
// URL on the blog becomes a way to probe the machine's network from inside it. "This
// site's own origin" is SITE_URL when it is configured, NOT the Host header the caller
// sent — see the note in the handler.
//
// The same-origin test is the gate; `safeFetch` is the backstop underneath it, because the
// fallback origin is the Host header and a Host header is not a fact about this server.
// The alternative — refusing to fetch at all unless SITE_URL is set — was rejected: the
// card URL is built from `settings.siteUrl` (the admin field), which an install configured
// through the UI alone leaves the env unaware of, so that rule would silently drop the
// background on a correctly configured site.
