// Figures: the picture, its caption, where it sits, the frame it may wear, and a gallery.

// Split out of `public.css.ts` on 2026-08-28, when adding the frame took that file past its
// 400-line cap. `check:docs` and `check:filesize` both say a file at the cap gets split
// rather than squeezed, and this was the section that could leave whole: everything here is
// about one element and nothing outside it reaches in. The two `.prose` rules travel with
// it because they exist ONLY to clear the float a `#third` figure makes — a clearing rule
// separated from the thing it clears is a rule nobody can explain.
//
// ORDER IS PRESERVED. It is composed immediately after `BASE_CSS`, which is where it used
// to sit; nothing before line 300 of that file touched a figure, and everything after it
// (the rail, the islands, book mode, mobile) still lands later and still wins, which is
// what `mobile.css.ts` relies on to unfloat a third-width picture on a phone.
//
// NO BACKTICKS below: this is one template literal and a backtick ends it.

/* SYMMETRIC AGAIN, 2026-09-14. The asymmetry above was measured under type settings whose
   paragraphs sit 55px apart, where 63px under a caption is 15% more and reads as belonging to
   the plate. A blog set like a book separates paragraphs by an INDENT instead: measured on the
   live site, two paragraphs sit 12px apart and the extra --sp put the text 49px under the
   caption, four times the body rhythm, which reads as a hole rather than as a plate. Spent in
   --sp either way, which is the claim typography.test.ts makes about this line. */

/* THE FRAME.
   Drawn on the IMG, not on a wrapper, and that is the whole design. An img with padding
   shows its background in the padding box, so the mat costs no extra element and no markup
   change - and the caption stays outside it, where a caption belongs. box-sizing is
   border-box for everything, so a framed picture is exactly as wide as an unframed one and
   nothing below it moves.

   THROUGH VARIABLES, so the site-wide default and a per-picture override can both exist
   without either knowing about the other - the same contract the gallery ratio already
   uses, and for the same hard reason: a rendered body is cached under a hash of its INPUT,
   so a default that rewrote the markup would leave every already-rendered post wearing the
   old frame until something unrelated evicted it. Through CSS it is instant instead.
   :root carries the site default (pageStyles, from settings). A figure class carries an
   override, including the override that says NO frame - which has to be sayable out loud
   once a site default exists to disagree with.

   THE STEPS ARE NAMED, and the site default points at a NAME rather than a length. That
   indirection is what makes the phone rule survive: the settings block is inlined AFTER the
   linked sheet, so a site default written as a length would outrank the media query and a
   thick default would keep its desktop mat on a 350px column. Pointing at --fig-step-* lets
   the media query redefine the step underneath it.

   Border WIDTH is the variable, not the border. A transparent 1px border still takes its
   2px out of a border-box picture, so an unframed image would quietly shrink by two pixels
   the day this shipped.

   The LINE is mixed rather than picked. The rule token is the site's divider colour and it
   is far too pale to hold a photograph (measured on the default palette: #ebebeb against a
   pale sky is invisible at 1px), while the meta colour at full strength reads as a heavy
   border. color-mix() lands between the two and stays inside the palette, so it still
   follows the theme. The plain rule-colour declaration before it is the fallback for an
   engine with no color-mix: a paler frame, never a missing one.

   INK inverts by itself: the heading colour is near-black on a light palette and near-white
   on a dark one, so one declaration gives a dark mat on paper and a light mat at night
   without a media query or a second token. */
