// Spellings of a URL that are not the URL, answered at the door with a 301.
//
// Two rules live here, and they are the same rule: a page has ONE address, and anything else
// that reaches the same bytes is a second URL for it. A trailing slash is one such spelling;
// `/page/1` is the other.
//
// A trailing slash is the SAME page, and until this existed it was a 404.
//
// No route in this app ends in a slash and Hono does not match one, so `/some-post/` missed
// every route and fell through. That is fine for a URL somebody typed and fatal for a site
// that MOVED here: every WordPress permalink carries a trailing slash. Measured on a real
// WordPress export: 468 old URLs, every one of the shape `https://example.com/{slug}/` — so pointing an
// imported domain at Quire would have answered 404 to every inbound link and every search
// result the site already had, which is most of what an import is for.
//
// It lives beside `cache-headers`, `security-headers` and `compress` rather than inside
// `app.ts` because it is the same kind of thing: a rule about every request, applied at the
// door, not a route.

/**
 * Page 1 of a listing IS the listing: `/category/x/page/1` is `/category/x`, the same for a
 * tag, and `/page/1` is wherever the post list currently lives.
 *
 * Both spellings rendered, identically, at two addresses — the plain duplicate-content
 * shape. `renderListing` has always LINKED page 1 at the bare path, so nothing this site
 * prints produced the second URL; what did is a person typing it, a crawler guessing the
 * pattern from `/page/2`, and an inbound link that has carried it since 1.x. 1.x resolved
 * this in `middleware.ts`; here it is the same regex one layer earlier than the routes, so
 * `/page/:n` and `/{kind}/:slug/page/:n` only ever see a real page number.
 *
 * The capture is the destination for a term archive. An empty group means the HOME listing,
 * which is not always `/`: once the owner gives the homepage to a page or the front (ADR
 * 0014), page 1 of the post list lives at `home.listPath` and `/` is a different document —
 * so redirecting there would send the reader somewhere else entirely. That is the same
 * `listRoot` `renderPostList` already puts in the canonical tag; this makes it an answer.
 *
 * Nothing else in the path can match: `/admin`, `/api` and `/uploads` have no `/page/1`
 * shape, and a post whose slug is literally `page` is served at `/page`, not at `/page/1`.
