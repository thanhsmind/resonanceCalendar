 * per page, 42.6 KB (13.8 KB gzipped) is this sheet and is byte-identical everywhere,
 * while only 6.1 KB (1.7 KB gzipped) actually varies with the owner's settings. Reading
 * three articles re-sent 41 KB of gzipped CSS for one page's worth of information.
 *
 * So the STATIC half moves here and is cached for a year, and the settings half stays
 * inline. The cascade is unchanged because the link is emitted before that inline block,
 * which is where the sheet sat in the assembled string.
 *
 * Minified once, here, on the way to being hashed. The sheets are commented the way the
 * rest of this codebase is, and those comments were going out on the wire: measured
 * 2026-07-30, 34,438 of the 65,645 bytes served were comment text, and a first visit paid
 * for all of it. Stripping them is worth about 14 KB compressed per cold visit, which is
