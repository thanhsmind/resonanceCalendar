// The composed front page. ADR 0014, part 2.
//
// NO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE: the whole sheet is one template literal and a backtick
// inside a prose comment ends it, which turns the rest of the CSS into TypeScript. That has
// already cost this project a boot.
//
// Two rules shape everything here.
//
// 1. Hierarchy comes from SIZE, then standfirst, then image, then rules — measured on the
//    NYT front page, where most stories carry no picture at all. So the two site kinds are
//    one grammar with the dials turned, not two layouts. `.front-text` raises the headline
//    a step and lets the standfirst run; `.front-image` gives the space to a picture.
// 2. It has to look finished with the IDE chrome OFF, which is the default for everybody
//    who installs this. The markers and brackets are a layer a site may add, never the
//    thing holding the design up.
//
// No cards, no boxes, no shadows: rules and whitespace do the separating, which is both what
// a newspaper front does and what the rest of this site already does.

/* The page is WIDER THAN THE READING COLUMN, and that is done by widening --shell-w for the
   whole document rather than by breaking this one element out of it.
   Photographed both ways. --shell-w is a measure tuned for one column of prose (672px by
   default), and three across inside it is not three columns, it is three slivers: the
   secondary headline came out in a 110px column, five ragged lines deep. Breaking only
   .front out fixed that and left the site header and footer still centred on the old narrow
   measure, visibly unrelated to the page under them. The override is emitted per render,
   beside the column counts, because the width is a setting. */
