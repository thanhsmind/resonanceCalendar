// Every list of posts that is not the front page: category, tag, series, the year archive,
// and the feed each of the first three now has of its own.
//
// Split out of `web/app.ts` on 2026-08-30, when that file was nine lines from its ceiling
// and the archive still had nowhere to be registered. The seam is the one the router
// already had a comment box for: these routes all resolve a NAME to a set of posts and hand
// the result to `listingPage`, while the front page resolves nothing and `/:slug` resolves
// one document.
//
// The per-term feeds live here rather than beside the site feed in `web/feed-routes.ts`
// because a term feed cannot be built without resolving the term first, which is this file's
// whole job. `feed-routes.ts` keeps the four documents that read no path segment at all.
