// Rules that apply only on a phone, last in the cascade so they win.
//
// The seam is a real one rather than an arbitrary split at the line limit: a phone is not a
// narrow desktop. A target that is comfortable under a mouse is not comfortable under a
// thumb, iOS zooms the page when a focused field is set below 16px, and hover is not a
// gesture a touch screen has. Nothing here matches above the phone breakpoint, so the
// desktop keeps the geometry it was measured into.
//
// The breakpoint is 639px, the width the sign-up form already stacks at. It is deliberately
// NOT the rail breakpoint: that one is computed from the reading column and decides where
// the sidebar lives, which is a different question from whether a thumb is doing the
// tapping.
//
// NO BACKTICKS anywhere below: check:css-literal enforces that.

   screen with nothing to spare. Measured at 390px: 64px of 390 went to gutters and the
   article set 33 characters to the line, against 67 on a laptop. Half the measure, on the
   site whose lead essay argues that 66 is the number.
   1.5rem, not 1rem. It is the whole win: at 390px both give 37 characters and 9 lines
   where 2rem gave 33 and 10, so going narrower buys nothing measurable and only pushes the
   words against the bezel. On a 360px Android the same step goes 30 to 33.

   .5rem row gap ADDED to the touch padding, so the drawer aired out to a ~27px void
