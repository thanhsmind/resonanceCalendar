 * not get by browsing: no drafts, no bodies.
 *
 * It sets its OWN cache-control, which is the point of it living beside `handleSearch`
 * rather than inline in the router. The blanket rule refuses a shared cache anything under
 * `/api`, correctly, and this is the one exception: it was rebuilt from every published post,
 * accent-folding each title, on every single request. A write purges the whole zone, so the
 * five-minute window costs a reader nothing in freshness.
