   source with a // opening the row, was a scribbled ellipse around two words that matched
   nothing else on the page: the header's own [/tim] and [toi] fill quietly and this one
   circled. One control answering the pointer in a vocabulary no other control speaks is not
   a signature, it is an exception, so it now fills like .icon-btn and the loop is gone from
   the tree along with INK_LOOP_SVG, which nothing else used.

   is display:none is not in the accessibility tree at all — so the text and the element's first
   appearance land in the same frame and a screen reader has no region to have been watching.
   The empty paragraph has no content and therefore no height; zeroing its margin is the whole
   of what the old rule was buying, and it stays where a reader's software can see it. Found in
   the 2026-09-19 audit; both public status lines had it.
