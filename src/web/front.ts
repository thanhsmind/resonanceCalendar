// they are, and where their posts come from.
//
// Not `renderListing`. A row is not a card: the lead is one post at h1 with a picture beside
// it, a strip is a labelled group with its own topic links, and a line is a headline with no
// body at all. Trying to serve both from one renderer is how a listing gains a field that a
// front page silently lacks, which is the failure the listing renderer's own header warns
// about.
