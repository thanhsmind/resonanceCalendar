/* A CODE BLOCK IS A PANEL, and until 2026-08-15 it was not one on any palette.

   pre carried padding, a radius and an overflow rule -- and no background of its own,
   because Shiki writes one as an INLINE style on every block it highlights. Its light theme
   (vitesse-light) writes #ffffff. This site's paper is #fcfcfc. So a code block was a white
   rectangle on a near-white page: the radius had nothing to round, the padding read as an
   indent, and the block differed from the prose around it only by being monospace. Reported
   as "tu dung thut lui lai thoi chu ko co gi khac biet".

   Two things are wrong with letting Shiki own it, and the colour is the smaller. A hex from
   a third-party theme is baked into HTML that is CACHED under a hash of its Markdown, so it
   outlives any palette the reader picks -- the same trap render/math.ts refuses for its
   error colour, and the rule CLAUDE.md states as public colours coming only from tokens.

   So the panel is derived from the palette: a fifth of the rule colour mixed into the page
   colour, which is a shade off the paper on every one of the six and stays right in dark
   with no second declaration. The hairline is the rule the tables already draw with -- a
   frame rather than a left bar, because the left bar is the blockquote's mark and two things
   sharing one mark is how a reader stops reading it.

   The important flag is not decoration: an inline style beats any selector without it. Only
   the block needs one -- measured across the fixture, Shiki emits no span backgrounds here,
   so a second rule to flatten them would guard nothing. */

   Written as colour alone, both marks came out at rgb(18,18,18) and rgb(22,22,22) against
   body text at rgb(38,38,38) -- invisible, because the DEFAULT palette is monochrome and
   --c-link and --c-accent are near-black in it on purpose. A device that does nothing on the
   palette most installs run is not a device.

   So the mark is weight, which every palette has, and the colour rides along for the ones
   that have a hue to give. Both kinds get the SAME treatment: a quoted literal and a $VAR
   are one category here -- machine values sitting inside human words -- and inventing a
   second distinction between them would be the guessing this whole file refuses. */

   Measured at 390px: a five-column table is 484px at its narrowest, and a table cannot be
   squeezed below its own content -- so with visible overflow the DOCUMENT went to 516px and
   every paragraph in the piece panned sideways with it.
   This rule sat on .prose:has(table) until 2026-09-01, which fixed that and broke the
   desktop: CSS has no way to scroll one axis alone, so an overflow-x that is not visible
   computes overflow-y to auto as well, and an article carrying one table became a scroll box
   as tall as the piece. Measured on a live post, clientHeight 4119 against scrollHeight 4120
   -- one pixel, and enough for Safari to draw a scrollbar down the side of the reading column
   and take that width out of the text.
   It could not sit on the table because overflow is ignored on a display:table box, and
   display:block shrink-to-fits it (607px down to 345px on a laptop). Both are true of the
   table and neither is true of a plain block around it, so render/post-content.ts wraps each
   table in one. The wrapper is the direct child of .prose, so it inherits the block rhythm

   stay here: a stylesheet whose values are variables ships once and caches; one assembled per
   site cannot. content/settings-table.ts decides what the values are.

   --tbl-min-col is the phone fix, and it is off by default because it is a CHOICE. .prose
   has carried overflow-x:auto for wide tables since it was written, and for a table of
   sentences it had never once engaged: a table that can shrink never overflows, so instead of
   scrolling it compressed. Measured at 375px on a two-column reference table -- first column
