/* --- THE SOURCE-CODE DIALECT (settings.look = code) -------------------------
   One deliberate contrast: the reading column stays analogue - a book serif, ranged
   left, no ornament - and everything AROUND it reads as source code. The two halves
   are supposed to disagree; that disagreement is the design.

   Every rule below is additive and lives behind one attribute, so turning the switch
   off in Admin leaves not a trace of it: this whole sheet stops being linked. Nothing here touches .prose, the post title,
   the card excerpts or the comment bodies: those are the reader's own words and they
   are the half that must NOT look technical.

   Colour comes from theme tokens only, as everywhere else. The two roles a code
   editor actually distinguishes are the comment and the literal, so that is what is
   borrowed: labels are comments (--c-meta), counts and dates are literals
   (--c-text). No third colour, and no hex.

   The literal was --c-accent for one deploy. This blog's Mono accent is red, so every
   date and count read as a link that was not one. --c-text is the ink the article is
   already set in: a clear step darker than the label, and silent. */

/* Labels are comments. The marker is CSS, not markup, so the heading a screen reader
   and a feed see stays the plain word.

   ONE list, covering every chrome label the site has. It used to be the rail alone, and
   the treatment stopped halfway down the article: the rail said "// Muc luc" and then the
   related posts, the sign-up card, the comment thread and the series head - all of them
   furniture, none of them the reader's words - said nothing at all. The tagline is in
   here because that is exactly what it is: the line under the name that says what this

/* --- THE WINDOW'S TWO EDGES, AND THE FACE THE CHROME SPEAKS IN --------------
   What this dialect drew before 2026-09-13 was a set of MARKS on the ordinary page, and on
   a blog whose chrome font was the default it was nearly indistinguishable from the plain
   look - because the default chrome font WAS the monospace, so the plain page was already
   speaking in code. The default moved to the neutral face (content/fonts.ts) and the
   monospace moved here, where it belongs.

   NO FILLED SURFACES. A tinted sidebar was drawn and rejected, then tinted bars top and
   foot, rejected too: this dialect dresses the chrome, and a filled panel turns a piece of
   furniture into a second surface arguing with the words. Two rules running the full width
   of the glass are what a window has that a page does not.

   font-family on body, NEVER on --font-sans: a blog whose reading font follows the chrome
   font has --font-reading: var(--font-sans), so moving that variable would set the ARTICLE
   in monospace, which is the one thing this dialect must never do.

   NO RULE UNDER THE HEADER AND NONE OVER THE FOOTER since 2026-09-14. They were two
   hairlines the width of the window, and with them went the three rules that existed only to
   carry them: the full-bleed margin-inline / padding-inline on both bars, which stretched
   a border no reader can see any more, and the overflow-x:clip on the root that stopped
   those full-bleed bars growing a horizontal scrollbar. Neither bar has a background, so
   removing the stretch moves nothing. The header keeps its 28px of air and the footer takes
   the 3rem the rest of the product gives it (public.css.ts) — it was .6rem here, which put
   the copyright line nine pixels off the bottom edge of the page with nothing under it. */

   chrome's face, and only the running text stays in the book serif. With the headlines in
   the serif the dialect read as the plain page with a monospace frame; a heading is a
   label for what follows, which is exactly the kind of word this dialect already sets in
   code. What stays analogue is still everything a reader reads for more than a line: the
   paragraphs, the standfirst, the excerpts and the comments.
