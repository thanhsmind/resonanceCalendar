// The response headers that cost nothing, apply to every response, and are wrong to omit.

// They were not sent at all. `docs/self-host.md` and the vhosts in `scripts/ops/` set them
// in nginx, so the live site has always had them — but that made them a property of ONE
// deployment's proxy rather than of the software, and a self-hoster who runs the binary
// behind anything else (a tunnel, a PaaS, Caddy with a default config, nothing at all)
// served the whole site without them and nothing said so.
//
// Deliberately NOT here: Content-Security-Policy. A useful policy depends on what the
// owner embeds — the frame-src list in the recommended vhost names YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok
// and Turnstile — and a browser enforces the INTERSECTION of every CSP header it receives,
// so a second, narrower policy from the app would silently break the proxy's tuned one.
// CSP stays a deployment decision, documented in `docs/self-host.md`.

/**
 * A SHORT `Permissions-Policy`, and the shortness is the design.
 *
 * A browser combines every policy it receives by taking the most restrictive, exactly as it
 * does with CSP — which is why CSP is not in this file at all (see the block at the top). The difference, and
 * the reason this one IS, is that every feature named below has no plausible use on a blog
 * at all: nothing in this software asks for a camera, a microphone, a location, a payment
 * sheet, a USB device or a motion sensor, and no proxy in front of it would ever want to
 * allow more of them. Denying those costs an owner nothing they could have wanted.
 *
 * What is NOT named is the point of the list. `fullscreen`, `autoplay`,
 * `picture-in-picture` and `encrypted-media` are left at their defaults because an owner may
 * embed a YouTube, Vimeo or TikTok player — the recommended vhost names all three in
 * `frame-src` — and a parent policy restricts what an iframe may do. `fullscreen=(self)`
 * would take the fullscreen button off an embedded video and nothing would say why.
 * `clipboard-write` is left alone for the same reason in reverse: the copy buttons on code
 * blocks and quotes need it, and its default allowlist already is `self`.
 *
 * `browsing-topics=()` opts out of Chrome's Topics API, which is the same answer this
 * software gives everywhere else: a reader is not an advertising audience.
