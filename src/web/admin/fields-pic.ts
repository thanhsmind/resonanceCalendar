/**
 * A SITE ICON, uploaded straight to the files store rather than chosen from the library.

 *
 * ⚠️ ONE FOOTPRINT, whatever size the picture inside it is. The slot is drawn at the size the
 * picture will be — a favicon is 32px and an app icon is not — so the row does not change height
 * the moment one goes in. Measured on the Blog tab: the two rows sit in the same card and their
 * "Choose an image" keys landed 16px apart, because the 32px slot and the 48px slot pushed the
 * words along by different amounts.
 *
 * ⚠️ 64px, AND THE PICTURE STANDS AT THE BOX'S LEFT EDGE. The box was 48 and centred what it
 * held, which fixed the keys and broke the pictures: a 32px favicon centred in 48 starts 8px in
 * from the 48px app icon below it, so the column had two left edges — measured x=808 against
 * x=800. And 48 was the larger of these two rows only; the portrait on the same screen is 64,
 * which pushed ITS keys 16px further right again (x=876 against x=860). One box at the largest
 * of the three, everything in it flush left: one edge for the pictures, one for the keys.
