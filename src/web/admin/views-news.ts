// The newsletter's two payloads: what can be sent, and who it would go to.
//
// Split from `views.ts` for the reason `views-home.ts` was, and the same one that keeps that
// file honest: it sits near its 400-line limit, and the Newsletter screen's conversion to
// server-rendered HTML (ADR 0054) needs a second view beside the first. One home for both.
//
// ⚠️ EVERYTHING HERE IS A READ. `src/news/` also holds the functions that open a TCP
// connection to a relay and put mail on it, and none of them is imported by this file or may
// ever be: a view is rendered by a GET, and a GET that sends a newsletter is the one bug this
// product cannot apologise for.

 * Who is on the list, what each address has actually been sent, and the three counts the

 *
 * THE COUNTS ARE FOLDED FROM THE LIST, not asked for separately. `subscriberCounts()` is
 * implemented by calling `listSubscribers()` a second time and filtering it three ways, so
 * asking for both read the whole table twice to answer one question. Same numbers, one read.
 *
 * The counts are over the WHOLE live set and never the filtered one: a total that changes as
 * you type is not a total.
 *
 * ⚠️ `getConfirmedSubscribers()` is the neighbouring function and it must never be used here.
 * It returns each address with its UNSUBSCRIBE TOKEN, which is a credential: anyone holding
 * one can take that reader off the list. This view goes to a client-bound payload.

/**
 * How many people the list draws at once.
 *
 * A newsletter is the one list here that grows without anybody deciding to grow it: every
 * sign-up adds a row, and a blog with twenty thousand readers drew twenty thousand rows and a
 * second copy of each for the phone layout. The three counts above the table are the WHOLE list
 * and are counted before the slice, because "1,240 confirmed" is the number the owner came for.
