 * The kernel stays as the FALLBACK, for a container or a BSD with no `os-release` to read. It
 * is labelled `os.type()` there — `Linux`, `Darwin` — so the number always belongs to the name
 * printed beside it, which is the failure the first cut had on a Mac: `os.release()` is Darwin's
 * version, and calling it "macOS" was only right by the coincidence that Apple aligned the two.
