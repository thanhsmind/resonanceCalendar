// The MCP endpoint at /api/mcp: Streamable HTTP, wired to the SDK by hand.
//
// The frozen tree used `mcp-handler`, which wraps the SDK for Next's route handlers and
// cannot be moved here. So this is the one piece of M3 that is a rewrite rather than a
// port — and it is a small one, because the protocol's stateless mode is exactly what a
// blog needs: every call is a JSON-RPC request in a POST body and a JSON-RPC response in
// the reply. No session id, no SSE stream, no server-initiated messages.
//
// A fresh `McpServer` per request. That sounds wasteful and is not: registering the tools
// is building a table of closures, the tools hold no state between calls, and the
// alternative — one long-lived server plus a session registry — is a cache to invalidate
// and a leak to bound, bought for nothing.

// The SDK is imported inside `handleMcp`, on the first MCP request a process ever serves —
// not here. Nothing else in the tree pulls it in, so a blog whose owner has not pointed an
// agent at `/api/mcp` never loads it at all. `registerTools` takes the type from
// `@/mcp/tools`, which imports it type-only and therefore costs nothing at runtime.
