// One payload per admin view, holding exactly the facts that view needs and nothing else.
//
// In the frozen tree each of these was a server component: it called `getIndex()` or
// `getAnalytics()` directly, assembled the props and rendered. The assembly still has to
// happen somewhere the database is reachable, and this is that somewhere. Two kinds of caller
// reach it since ADR 0054: the screens in `web/admin/screens/` call these functions straight
// while they draw the page, and `viewRoutes()` at the bottom, mounted by `web/app.ts`, serves
// the few payloads the browser still fetches for itself (the palette's search, analytics' poll,
// the writing sheet's own view). Deliberately NOT a generic query API: the shape each page
// needs is already known, and a generic one would turn one round trip into five.
//
// Each payload is built by a NAMED function with an INFERRED return type, and that is the
// typed contract: a caller reads fields off what the builder returned, so renaming one here is
// a compile error where it is read rather than a blank panel. Until 2026-08-29 these were
// thirteen inline object literals and the reader asserted whatever shape it liked, so a rename
// left `tsc` green while the screen went blank. Keep the returns inferred: an annotation like
// `Record<string, unknown>` reopens the hole this closed.
//
// Everything is gated by the router group (Invariant 4) and nothing is cached: the admin
// must never show a stale snapshot of the reader's own edits.
