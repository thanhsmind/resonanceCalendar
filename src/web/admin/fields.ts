// THE SETTINGS FORM'S VOCABULARY, as HTML the server sends (ADR 0054).
//
// THE RULE, and it is the only one: a setting reads top to bottom as **what it is, what to know
// about it, then the control**. Never a hint under the control it explains, never a second note
// style beside the first, never a caller's own idea of the spacing between them. The React
// screens drifted the moment that was implicit — the font pickers put their hint below the
// grid, the palette card carried a tinted callout AND a plain paragraph, and the gap between a
// label and its control was 0.5, 1 or 2 depending on the file. Deciding it once, here, is this
// module's whole argument for existing.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY CONTROL CARRIES `data-k`, ITS DOTTED KEY PATH, AND NOTHING ELSE. `typography.bodyFont`
// is one attribute; the island splits it, rebuilds the object and sends the partial, because
// `PUT /api/settings` merges. There is no settings payload in the page: what a field WAS is what
// the browser already holds for it — `defaultValue` on an input, `defaultSelected` on an option,
// `data-was` on a switch (a `<button>` has no default to read). So the unsaved count is exact
// without a baseline copy of sixty-three keys riding in an attribute.
