// The activity log, as HTML the server sends (ADR 0054, step 1).
//
// THE FIRST SCREEN TO CONVERT, and it was chosen by measuring rather than by the plan: 0054
// names the forms first on the reasoning that a form is "mostly inputs that POST", but the
// settings screen is 7,120 lines across 62 components of its own, seven times the next
// heaviest. The log is 220 lines across two. Cheapest first is the right rule; which screen is
// cheapest was a guess.
//
// EVERY ROW IS IN THE MARKUP, and the three controls filter what is already there. That is not
// a compromise of the old behaviour, it is what the old behaviour already was: the endpoint
// caps at 200 entries, React fetched all of them and filtered in memory, and the search box
// has to answer a keystroke without a round trip. So the server sends the same 200 rows it
// used to send as JSON, spelled as sentences instead, and the island hides the ones that do
// not match. The same trick the rail uses, for the same reason.
//
// The clear control is the sheet-top's one tool, and it is the only thing on this screen that
// writes anything.
