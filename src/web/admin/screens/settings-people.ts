// Settings → Comments & mail: how readers answer back, and how mail leaves this machine.
//
// ADR 0041, and this tab is the clearest case that ADR makes. "How do readers sign in to
// comment?" used to be answered in two places three tabs apart: the switch that enables comments
// was on Reading, and the Google and Turnstile keys that decide how a commenter proves they are
// a person were on Connections. That is how `googleAuth` ran switched on for weeks with no
// credentials behind it and nothing on either screen saying so.
//
// ADR 0054: the server draws it. All three cards REACH something the sheet's one Save key cannot
// — a provider that can be asked whether a key is good, a mail host that can be asked whether
// mail leaves — so all three are `connectionCard`s and each keeps a key of its own. The ordinary
// settings keys on them (`comments.*`) still ride the sheet's Save as well, which is ADR 0041 as
// revised on 2026-09-07.
//
// ⚠️ NO SECRET IS WRITTEN HERE, AND EVERY CREDENTIAL FIELD IS WRITE-TO-SET. A stored credential
// never comes back from the server — `getIntegrationStatus()` turns each one into a boolean — so
// the field ships EMPTY with a placeholder saying one is stored, and only a field somebody has
// typed into is sent. Blank means KEEP: anything else silently wipes a working key the first
// time the panel is saved to change something else (`useSecretKeys.ts` carries the same rule for
// the three React panels that are still to be converted).
//
// ⚠️ NO `data-k` ON A CREDENTIAL OR ON THE SMTP FORM. `data-k` is what puts a control into the
// sheet's diff and into the payload its Save sends, and neither of these is in the site record:
// the keys go to `/api/comments/keys` and the mail host to `/api/mail`. They carry
// `data-card-field` instead — the name the card's own save reads — which `settings-form.ts` does
// not look at.
//
// ⚠️ THE MAIL CARD SHIPS EMPTY AND THE ISLAND FILLS IT. `settingsView()` does not read the SMTP
// configuration — the React card fetched `/api/mail` on mount and this conversion does not
// change where the fact comes from — so both faces are in the markup, the waiting line showing
// and the form hidden, the way the security card's device list is drawn on the Account tab.
