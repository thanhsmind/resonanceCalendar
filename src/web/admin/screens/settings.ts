// Settings, as HTML the server sends (ADR 0054) — the last screen before the editor.
//
// ⚠️ ALL SEVEN PANELS SHIP DRAWN, and here that is load-bearing rather than tidy. The Save key
// stores the WHOLE form: an owner changes the blog's name on one tab, the front page's shape on
// another and a palette on a third, and presses Save once. Drawing one tab and navigating
// between them would make every switch a page load, and a page load with unsaved work either
// loses it or raises the browser's own two-button warning — on the one screen in this admin
// where leaving without saving throws work away.
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING HERE IS A FORM, and every button says `type="button"`. This screen drives the most
// dangerous routes in the admin — the password, the recovery codes, the second factor, MCP
// tokens, backups, imports, a CDN purge — and `ui/Button` emits a button with no type, which
// HTML reads as submit. `settings-safety.test.ts` asserts the shape on the rendered markup.
//
// ⚠️ NO SECRET IS EVER IN THE PAGE. `getIntegrationStatus()` turns every stored credential into
// a boolean; a credential field ships EMPTY with a placeholder saying one is stored, because
// sending the dots back would store the dots.
