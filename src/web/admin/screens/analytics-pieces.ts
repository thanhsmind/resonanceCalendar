// THE PIECE INDEX: every piece, and the way into its own numbers (ADR 0054).
//
// The top table is the screen's default face and stays that way — it answers "what is doing
// well", which is the question most days. This answers the other one, "how is THIS piece
// doing", for a piece that is not in the top ten and never will be. Before it existed the only
// door to a drill-down was a row in that table, so the fortieth piece had no route to its own
// page at all while the number it wanted was already computed.
//
// Deliberately not a ranking and deliberately not capped: a "top 50" here would put the same
// wall one row further down. It is ordered by views because that is the useful default order,
// and the FILTER is the control — type three letters and the list is the piece you meant.
//
// THE JOIN MOVED TO THE SERVER with the conversion, and that is the one change of substance.
// React joined `pieces` to `titles` on every render so that a piece with no views still had a
// row; the server does it once, into markup, and the island never builds a row at all.
//
// ⚠️ TEN ROWS AND A WAY TO SEE THE REST, with no scroll box of its own. It was
// `max-h-96 overflow-y-auto`: a 384px window inside a page that already scrolls, so a wheel
// over the table moved the table and a wheel two pixels left moved the page, and the box ended
// wherever 384px happened to fall — measured, through the middle of a row's glyphs.
