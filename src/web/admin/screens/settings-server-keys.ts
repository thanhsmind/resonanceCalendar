// on — plus the one shape they all use to ask for a secret.
//
// ⚠️ NOT ONE SECRET IS WRITTEN HERE, and it is not an oversight that the fields look empty.
// These keys live in the server-only `integration_keys` table and are NEVER returned:
// `getIntegrationStatus()` hands back booleans plus the values that are deliberately public —
// the Cloudflare zone, the bucket name, the AI provider and model. A credential field therefore
// ships BLANK with a placeholder saying one is stored, and blank means KEEP: the save sends
// only the fields that were typed into, because anything else silently wipes a working key the
// first time somebody saves the card to change something else (`useSecretKeys.ts`).
//
// ⚠️ NO `data-k` ON ANY CREDENTIAL. `data-k` is what puts a control in the sheet's diff and in
// the payload its one Save sends; an API token is none of the sheet's business and its endpoint
// is not `PUT /api/settings`. They wear `data-cf-*`, `data-ai-*` and `data-s3-*`, which the
// form's reader does not look at. `keys: []` on those cards says the same thing to the island:
// nothing here can make the settings form dirty.

 * listing models is the cheapest request that still has to authenticate. So the select ships

 * drew when the list failed: obviously not a menu, still an answer. The island removes
 * `disabled` and fills it once the provider has replied.

 * ⚠️ THE FOUR REFUSALS RIDE AS ATTRIBUTES. The provider's own sentence is the half that
 * explains WHICH of the several things that return 401 has happened — a revoked key, a key from
 * the wrong account, a project with no billing — and the island has no locale dictionary to put
