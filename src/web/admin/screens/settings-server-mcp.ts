// ⚠️ THE TOKEN TABLE SHIPS EMPTY, because the page drawing this has not called
// `GET /api/mcp/tokens`. It is drawn with its head, an empty `<tbody>` and a `<template>` for a
// row; "No tokens yet." is what is VISIBLE, because that is the honest state of a render that
// knows of none. `island/lib/settings-mcp.ts` asks, and fills it.
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING HERE MINTS ANYTHING, and that is about this FILE, not about the card. Every key is
// an inert `type="button"` carrying a hook; the island presses them. A credential written into
// this markup would be a credential in the page source of every settings screen ever opened —
// the plaintext of a token exists only in the reply that creates it, and the box that shows it
// once ships empty for the island to fill.
//
// ⚠️ THE SECOND SENTENCE USED TO SAY THERE WAS NO HANDLER ANYWHERE, and for three days it was
// true of Generate, Refresh, Copy and Delete as well. A card that lists tokens it cannot mint
// or revoke is not the authority `docs/mcp.md` says the admin is.

 * one at a time, so at the width the settings column actually is, Read-only sat beside Refresh
 * and Custom code landed alone on the next line under the key — two halves of one question
 * drawn as if they were unrelated. `basis-full` rather than letting them wrap on their own: a
 * pair that sometimes fits beside the keys and sometimes does not is a layout that moves when
 * the window does.
 *
 * They are `checkField`, where React had two bare `input[type=checkbox]` with no accent class —
 * which is not unstyled but painted in the OS accent, i.e. blue, on a monochrome admin. Neither
 * box mints `full`, which is what every token was before scopes existed; `code` is the rarer
 * grant and is mutually exclusive with read-only, because "reads nothing but may set custom
 * head HTML" is not a thing anybody means. That exclusion is the island's — it is a rule about

/**
 * The card.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ADDRESS AND THE TOKENS ARE GATED ON THE SAVED SWITCH, not on the one in the form, and
 * `data-gate-live` is a different hook from `data-gate` for exactly that reason. This card has
 * its own Save, so flipping the switch leaves the endpoint off until the key is pressed — and
 * showing the URL on the flip meant the card handed out an address, and the manager below it
 * handed out a credential, for a door that was still shut. Measured 2026-09-11 on a fresh
 * install: switch flipped, token minted, URL copied, and every call answered 404 until the
 * settings row was actually written. So the island opens these two blocks only while the key is
 * on AND the card is clean, where `data-gate` follows the switch the instant it moves.
 *
 * The switch and the address live in ONE child of the list rather than two. `divide-y` draws its
 * rule between children and `:last-child` counts a node that is `hidden` — so as siblings, a
 * closed address block would leave the switch above it wearing a hairline with nothing under it
 * (`docs/admin-one-dom.md`, trap 4). Nested, the list has one child whichever way the switch is,
 * and the address keeps the `border-t` React drew on it. `.panel-list .switch-row.p-4` is a
 * DESCENDANT rule, so the row inside the wrapper still gets its 16px back.
