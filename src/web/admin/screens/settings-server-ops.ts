// Settings → Server: WHAT THIS INSTALL DOES ON ITS OWN — what it holds in memory, what it asks
// the internet once a day, what it will accept onto the disk, and what it copies before the
// disk is gone.
//
// Two cards. The first is four ordinary settings keys with one Save. The second was counted
// among the "made of actions" cards and should not have been: running a snapshot is an action,
// but the SCHEDULE beside it is three settings keys, and with no key on the card and none on
// the tab there was nowhere to store them from.
//
// ⚠️ MARKUP HERE, BEHAVIOUR IN THE ISLAND (ADR 0054). Every key on this tab is an inert
// `type="button"` in this file, carrying a hook; what a press does is
// `admin/island/lib/settings-lists.ts`.
//
// ⚠️ AND THIS COMMENT ONCE SAID THE SNAPSHOT DELETE HAD NO HANDLER. It gained one and the
// sentence stayed, so a reader checking whether that delete asked before unlinking an archive
// was told there was nothing to check. It fetched on its first statement for three days.
//
// ⚠️ THE BACKUP LIST IS NOT A SERVER READ. It comes from `GET /api/backup/list`, which the page
// that draws this has not called, so the list ships EMPTY with its row in a `<template>`, the
// lamp ships amber and the last-run line says "Never". That is the honest state of a render
// that knows of no snapshots — not a claim that there are none.

 * by a wide margin, and the clearest case of the long-windedness reported across this screen —
 * and it is the one note here that must not lose a word, because a summary of it would be a
 * weaker promise. So the text is untouched and the wall is gone: a `<summary>` saying what the
 * paragraph is about, which is an invitation to open it rather than a replacement for it.
 *
 * `badge`, not a disabled switch, and it prints the VARIABLE that is in the way rather than a
 * sentence about it. Two things override this setting — an operator's `UPDATE_CHECK=0`, and a
 * build started without `NODE_ENV=production` — and a switch left ON above a check that will
 * never run is a screen telling its owner something untrue. The switch itself stays live: the
 * value is the owner's and outlives whoever is hosting them this month.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY THE TRUE STATE OF THE RELEASE LINE IS DRAWN, which is the one place this tab departs
 * from "every state ships drawn" — and it is not a state the page can move to. Being behind is
 * a fact the SERVER learned on its own clock; the island cannot make it true, and the version,
 * the link and the date exist only when it is. Drawing an empty shell of it would be inventing
