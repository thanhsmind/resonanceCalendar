// Settings → Appearance: HOW THE SITE LOOKS. What kind of publication it is, what shape
// everything is, what colour, what face — and the owner's own CSS when the knobs run out.
//
// ⚠️ THREE CARDS LEFT ON 2026-09-07 (ADR 0041), and the measurement is why. This tab carried
// 137 controls over 2,825px while five other tabs sat within 31px of 1,236 — 36% of every
// control on the settings screen behind one word. Tables and the pen went to Posts, because
// both draw INSIDE a post's body and neither is a palette decision; text rendering, motion, the
// key sounds and the autosave interval went to Account, because they describe the TOOL and this
// tab is about what a reader sees.
//
// ADR 0054: the server draws it. The palette editor is `settings-appearance-theme.ts` and the
// type scale is `settings-appearance-type.ts` — three files because one would be past the
// 400-line cap before the first colour field, not because the three are three subjects.
//
// ⚠️ THREE KEYS HERE CANNOT BE SAID IN A DOTTED PATH, and each rides a hidden input the island
// writes: `enabledPalettes` (a list), `customFont` (a family and a variable-length array of
// faces) and `themePreset` (no control of its own). `settings-form.ts` has to learn `data-k-list`
// and `data-k-json` before any of the three saves — see the notes at each one.
//
// Save-all: every key here goes through the sheet's one Save key.

/**
 * The two font pickers.
 *
 * The TOP grid sets `fontPreset` — the reading font — AND drops that font's tuned typography
 * into the roles below, because a serif runs small and wants a tighter leading than a sans, so
 * the reading setup travels with the font. The BOTTOM row sets `chromeFont` independently: pick
 * a code font for the furniture while the body stays readable.
 *
 * These tiles are painted in the face they offer, at one `font-size`, and the difference in
 * apparent size is part of the answer: Source Serif 4 renders 11% smaller than JetBrains Mono at
 * the same size, and a picker that hid that would be lying about the choice.
 *
 * ⚠️ THEY CARRIED A `data-specimen` HOOK TO OPT OUT OF THE ADMIN'S x-height NORMALISATION, and
 * that normalisation left `admin.css` when `font-size-adjust` did — it broke every leading it
 * touched. The hook outlived the rule by long enough that its note still described it.
 *
 * The note sits ABOVE the grid it explains, where it sat below both pickers. Two columns in the
 * chrome row, matching the reading grid: it was three, and `CHROME_FONTS` grew to four when
 * JetBrains Mono was added, so the fourth choice sat alone on a second row at half the width.

/**
 * THE BOX WHERE THIS PRODUCT STOPS HAVING ANSWERS AND HANDS YOU THE PEN.
 *
 * It was an eight-row `<textarea>`, which is fine for a two-line tweak and wrong for what this
 * box IS: Quire Ink ships no themes, so when the settings run out your own CSS is the whole of
 * the remaining answer. Three things it does, and each is here for a reason:
 *
 *   1. THE CONTRACT IS IN THE BOX. The names the software promises not to rename
 *      (`content/appearance-contract.ts`) are listed beside the editor, one line of explanation
 *      each, and clicking one writes it at the cursor. That list used to exist only in
 *      `docs/appearance.md` on GitHub — so the person most likely to need it, sitting in the
 *      settings screen, was the person furthest from it.
 *   2. IT SAYS WHAT IS WRONG. An unclosed brace is the single most common way a stylesheet does
 *      nothing at all, and the old box gave no sign: you saved, the page did not change, and
 *      nothing anywhere said why.
 *   3. IT SAYS WHAT IT COSTS. This text ships inside every public page, on every request.
 *
 * No highlighting and no dependency: an overlay behind a textarea has to keep two layers in
 * identical wrap for every font, zoom and word, and when it drifts it drifts by a character,
 * which looks like a bug in the editor rather than in the overlay.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO `space-y-*` DOWN THIS STACK. Its last child is the contract panel, which ships hidden —
 * and Tailwind writes that gap as `& > :not(:last-child)`, which counts a node nobody can see
 * (`docs/admin-one-dom.md`, trap 4). The 8px rides on each following block as `mt-2`, because a
 * `display:none` box contributes no margin at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ ALL THREE FACES OF THE STATUS LINE SHIP, and the SERVER picks. `braceBalance` is in
 * `@/admin-shared/css-brace` precisely so that the page and the island reach the same answer
 * from one copy — a stored stylesheet with an unclosed brace says so in the first frame, not
 * after the script lands. The island rewrites the same three spans as the text is typed.
