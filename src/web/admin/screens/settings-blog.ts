/**
 * Every zone the RUNTIME knows — asked for rather than listed.
 *
 * A list written here would be a second copy of the IANA database, staler than the one the
 * browser already ships and wrong the first time a country changes its rules, which they do
 * several times a decade. The fallback is not a shorter list but the ONE zone that is always
 * right, because a half-list would quietly hide somebody's own country from them.
 *
 * ⚠️ WITHOUT `Etc/GMT±N`, AND THE SIGN IS WHY. In those 26 names the sign is INVERTED against
 * every other way a person writes an offset: `Etc/GMT+1` is UTC MINUS one hour. They are in the
 * database for POSIX compatibility, and a blog's owner scrolling a list of 445 zones for
 * somewhere to put their publishing clock is not the audience for that trap. The browser
 * agrees — Chrome leaves them out of `supportedValuesOf` and this list was the browser's until
 * ADR 0054 moved it to the server, where the engine hands back all 26 (measured 2026-09-15:
 * Bun 445, Chrome 419). Filtering them keeps the answer the same on both sides of that move.

 * the owner something untrue about their own blog, on a control where the only way to find out
 * is to publish something at the wrong hour. Filtering above makes that reachable on purpose;
 * an engine built against an older database, or a value written by an import, makes it
