// the server sends (ADR 0054).
//
// A slim column of everything written, most recently touched first: search that reaches the
// body, the scope tabs, and one dark key for a new piece. Rows show the WRITING — title, then
// the matched line while searching or the standing first line otherwise.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS DRAWN ON ALL FOUR WRITING ROUTES, by the server, once. It was a React component the
// shell mounted outside the router so that clicking a row swapped only the sheet; under this ADR
// a row click is a real navigation, so there is nothing to keep alive across one — and the thing
// that had to be avoided at all costs, `WritePane` written twice (once as HTML for the list,
// once as React beside the editors), is avoided by the editors being drawn here too.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY ROW IS DRAWN AND THE FILTERS HIDE (`docs/admin-one-dom.md`, trap 2). Kind, status and
// what a piece is missing are all facts written onto the row, and the island sets an attribute
// on the column. Nothing is refetched to filter, and the one filter that arrives in the address
// is applied by the SERVER so the narrowed list is right in the first frame.

 * On the write screen itself the pane IS the page: a capped column, then a sidebar from 1280 up.

 * ⚠️ `w-full` WITH NO CEILING IS WHAT THIS REPLACES, and the number it reached is the argument.
 * Measured 2026-09-21 in a browser, walking the excerpt's own font to characters:
 *
 *   390px  41ch      768px  86ch      1100px  116ch
 *   600px  68ch      900px  101ch     1279px  140ch
 *
 * `docs/conventions/type.md` puts the reading measure at 45 to 75 characters and records this
 * project's own reading column landing at 67 to 72. A hundred and forty is not a near miss. It
 * is worst in the 1024–1279 band, where the rail is FORCED shut by `NARROW` and hands the list
 * every pixel it gave up — so the window that makes the chrome smallest makes the text longest.
 *
 * `max-w-prose` is 65ch of the COLUMN's own font, which holds the 12px excerpt at **80
 * characters** at every width from 600 up — measured, not derived, because the two fonts are
 * different sizes and the arithmetic between them is not worth trusting. 80 is over the band's
 * 75 and stays there deliberately: this line is clamped to two and scanned, not read, and the
 * width buys a second line of excerpt that a stricter cap would cut. The fault was 140 growing
 * without limit, not the last five characters.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS `max-w-prose` AND NOT `max-w-[38rem]`, which is what this was written as first.
 * `utilities.css` is a CAPTURED file, not a scan — an arbitrary value that is not already in it
 * produces no rule, the class lands in the markup and does nothing, and `check:admin-css` is
 * green either way. It was caught by measuring the page and finding the number unchanged.
 *
 * `mx-auto` because a capped column hugging the left with 400px of nothing beside it reads as a
 * layout that broke, not one that chose. It needs no `xl:` reset and was written with two:
 * above 1280 the column is 320px inside a flex row whose sibling grows, so the free space is
 * already spoken for and both margins measure 0 there. A reset for a margin that is not
 * applied is a class that has to be kept true forever for no effect.
