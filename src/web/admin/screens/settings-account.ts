// ADR 0041 put two things here that had nowhere else to be: how the OWNER signs in, which used
// to sit under System beside the cache and the importer, and the handful of preferences that
// describe this TOOL rather than the blog — the dashboard's footer line, the activity log, the
// editor's chrome, motion, the key sounds, the autosave interval. Those last were on Appearance,
// a tab about what READERS see, so an owner turning off a sound they alone hear was changing a
// setting filed under their site's looks.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE DRAWS MARKUP AND NOTHING ELSE (ADR 0054). The security card's controls each
// commit something irreversible — a password changed, a set of recovery codes replaced, a
// second factor re-enrolled, a device signed out — and every one of them is INERT here: a
// `type="button"` with a hook on it and no behaviour behind it. There is no `<form>` on this
// screen, and on this card that is load-bearing rather than tidy: a form would let Return in
// the password box post a password change.
//
// ⚠️ NO SETTINGS KEY ON THE SECURITY CARD. `data-k` is what puts a control in the sheet's diff
// and in the payload its one Save sends; a password, a one-time code and a recovery list are
// none of the sheet's business. Those controls carry `data-sec-*` instead, which the form's
// reader does not look at.
//
// ⚠️ NO SECRET IS WRITTEN HERE. The recovery codes, the TOTP secret and the session list all
// come from `GET /api/security`, which the page has not called at render time — so the count
// ships at zero, the secret box and the device list ship EMPTY, and the island fills them.
// Nothing on this screen reads a secret out of the server view, and there is no server view
// that would hand one over.
