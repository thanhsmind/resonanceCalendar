// The analytics overview, as HTML the server sends (ADR 0054).
//
// ONE SHEET: the range on its first row, the numbers standing directly on the paper, then the
// chart, the pages, the sources — all divisions drawn by hairlines, nothing floating in its own
// little card.
//
// The whole screen is READING. Of 889 lines of React across six files, the only two pieces of
// state were a search box and a "show all" toggle, both of which work over rows the server can
// draw once; everything else was a fetch, a join and a re-render on the way to markup that
// never changed. That is why the island is small and this file is the shape of the page.
