// WHICH ADMIN SCREENS THE SERVER DRAWS, and what each one's island is called.
//
// ADR 0054 converted fourteen screens one at a time, and all fourteen are here: every admin
// address arrives as finished HTML, and this table is the only place a screen's name and its
// island are written down. An address the table does not claim is no longer a gap waiting for
// a second program to fill it, because there is no second program: `spa.ts` draws the dead end
// itself. The overlays that belong to no screen (the palette, the shortcut sheet, the confirm
// dialog, the toast) are drawn into the shell by `web/admin/overlays.ts`.
//
// WHAT THE STAMP IS FOR. `spa.ts` asks this table; when it answers, the screen's markup goes
// into the canvas and `<html>` is stamped `data-admin-screen` with the name used here, or with
// `not-found`. Nothing in the browser routes off it any more. It is kept because it is the one
// place the SERVER states which screen it decided to draw, and the tour reads it to prove a
// flow landed on the screen it asked for rather than on the dead end: markup that merely looks
// right cannot answer that question. One stamp, so there is no second list to disagree with.
//
// A screen leaves this table only by being deleted from it, which cannot happen quietly: the
// address falls through to the dead end the moment the entry goes, and `check:routes` and the
// tour both cover it either way.

 * column drawn twice, once as HTML and once as React, is the drift this ADR's markup rules
 * exist to prevent. Their island is the SHEET's, and it wires the column by importing the
 * column's own — one module, not a second copy of it.
