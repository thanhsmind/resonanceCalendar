// The trash, as HTML the server sends (ADR 0054, step 2 of the lists).
//
// SEVEN KINDS, ALL SEVEN DRAWN. The old screen fetched one JSON payload holding every kind and
// then rendered whichever tab was chosen; every row for all seven was already in memory. So the
// markup carries the same seven lists and the island shows one — "one DOM per state", the rail's
// rule, and the same trade the log screen made. It is not more bytes on the wire than the JSON
// it replaces, and it is the difference between a tab that swaps in a frame and a tab that
// swaps after a route, a bundle and a fetch.
//
// THE TICKS ARE REAL CHECKBOXES and the row buttons are real buttons, so the screen is usable
// with a keyboard before any JavaScript arrives. What it cannot do without the island is act:
// restore and delete are POSTs, and the island is what sends them.
//
// EVERY DESTRUCTIVE ACTION ASKS, through `quire:confirm` rather than the browser's own dialog.
// The reason is the log island's and it matters more here: an unheard question is a REFUSAL,
// because this is the one screen where the answer cannot be walked back.

/**
 * One trashed item: the thing, when it went, and the two keys that decide its fate.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE LINE, AND THE VERBS ARE KEYS. This row was two lines and the second one existed to
 * carry "Restore" and "Delete permanently" as words — 143px of every 614px row, the same two
 * words twenty times down the page, and 65px of row height where 28 of it said nothing the row
 * above had not already said. Measured 2026-09-16 on twenty rows.
 *
 * So the verbs become the square key every other list row in this admin uses for its actions,
 * the date moves up beside the name, and the row is one line: 20 rows lost 420px of height and
 * the screen stopped reading as a wall of repeated words.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT HIDDEN UNTIL HOVER. The comments queue reveals its delete key that way and says why —
 * a moderator reads far more rows than they act on — but it does it with `opacity-0` and no
 * `pointer: coarse` answer, so on a phone that key is invisible and unreachable. A trash whose
 * Restore could not be found on a phone would be worse than a noisy one.
 *
 * ⚠️ BOTH KEYS CARRY A NAME. An icon-only button has no accessible name of its own, and these
 * two are the difference between putting something back and destroying it. `aria-label` for the
 * screen reader, `title` for the pointer, and the red ballpoint for the eye.
 *
 * `data-find` is the name AS TYPED, not folded. The log folds its haystack on the server so a
 * keystroke costs one `includes` per row, and that is right for a ledger of two hundred lines
 * matched by a plain substring. This screen's search is `accent.ts`'s rule instead — a word
 * typed without accents matches any, a word typed WITH them means them — which needs the three
 * lanes of the original text rather than one folded copy, and the island builds those once on
 * the first keystroke. Folding here would quietly turn "lề" back into a search that also finds
 * "lệ". `data-name` is what the question will say out loud, so the island never has to read it
 * back out of the markup it drew — a name with a comma or a quote in it survives the trip as an
 * attribute and would not survive being re-parsed out of a paragraph.
