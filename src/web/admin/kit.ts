// sheet, a field cannot drift apart while both exist.
//
// TEMPLATE STRINGS, not JSX, and it is a decision rather than an inconvenience. The root
// TypeScript project is configured for hono's JSX and nothing uses it: the reading site has
// rendered HTML by concatenation since it was written. ADR 0054's own consequence is that the

// second templating language for the admin alone would break that on the first screen.
//
// It grows one screen at a time, deliberately. A primitive arrives here when a converting
// screen needs it, with its reasoning; a speculative port of all forty would be forty class
// lists nobody has looked at on a screen.
