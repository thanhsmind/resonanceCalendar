// The admin's rail, as HTML the server sends (ADR 0054).
//
// It was 803 lines of React across three files, plus six more they pulled in, and it rendered
// on the browser's second pass after a bundle had been fetched, parsed and run. It is markup
// now, in the same response as the page, and the behaviour is one plain-TypeScript island
// (`src/admin/island/rail.ts`).
//
// ONE DOM, WHATEVER STATE THE RAIL IS IN, and that is the decision the rest of this file
// follows from. React drew a different tree for each of collapsed, icons-off and group-closed;
// here every row, every label and every glyph is in the markup always, and three attributes on
// `<html>` — written before the first paint by `railBootScript` — decide what is shown. The
// reasons are stacked:
//
//   · NO FLASH. The server cannot read `localStorage`, so a rail rendered in one state and
//     corrected afterwards is a rail that visibly moves on every single load. The reading
//     site's theme has worked this way since it was written; this is the same trick.
//   · A TOGGLE IS AN ATTRIBUTE. Collapsing the rail sets one character, and the browser does
//     the rest from CSS it already has. Nothing is rebuilt, so nothing can be rebuilt wrongly.
//   · THE ISLAND STAYS SMALL. It has no opinion about what a row looks like, which means it
//     cannot disagree with this file about it.
//
// WHAT IS *NOT* IN THE MARKUP: arrange mode. The grip and the two steppers on eighteen rows
// are ~14 KB of SVG for a mode somebody enters twice a year, so the island builds them when
// the mode is entered. That is the one place it draws anything.

/**
 * The script that runs before the first paint.
 *
 * Everything in it is a decision the SERVER cannot make: three `localStorage` preferences, a
 * media query, and whether the keyboard has a Command key. Each one is a visible property of
 * the rail, so reading them after the first paint means a rail that is briefly the wrong width,
 * the wrong density, or printing `Ctrl` to somebody on a Mac.
 *
 * SYNCHRONOUS, in the head, for that reason alone. ⚠️ NOT INLINE: `spa.ts` serves this as
 * `/admin/assets/boot.<hash>.js`, because a strict `script-src 'self'` blocks an inline script
 * and three of the four public instances send one. See `BOOT` there, and the rule it amends in
 * `docs/performance.md`.
 *
 * It writes the attributes and STOPS. Every click after this is the island's, which arrives
 * with the rest of the page; a rail that could only be collapsed once the bundle had loaded
 * would still be correct, and this is about the frame before that.
 *
 * ⚠️ `data-daypart` IS NOT THE RAIL'S, and it is here anyway. The dashboard's greeting reads
 * the BROWSER's clock on purpose — a site in Asia/Bangkok read by its owner in Berlin should
 * say good evening when it is evening where the eyes are — so the server draws all four
 * greetings and this decides which one shows. It belongs to whichever script runs before the
 * first paint, and there is exactly one of those; a second inline script in the head to carry
 * one attribute would be a second thing in the place `docs/performance.md` guards most.
 *
 * The four boundaries here and `partOfDay` in `admin-shared/when.ts` are the same arithmetic
 * written twice, which is the one duplication in this file: the boot script cannot import.
 * `when.ts` names this as its pair, and the greeting test walks both.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE THEME IS IN HERE NOW, and the comment above this script in `spa.ts` has claimed it was
 * since the day that comment was written. It was not: the resolution lived only in the island
 * (`wireTheme`), which is a MODULE and therefore deferred, so a dark-mode admin painted light
 * until the bundle ran. The four modes are resolved twice, here and there, for the same reason
 * the day boundaries are — and the island keeps its copy because the mode can change while the
 * page is open, which this one-shot cannot see.
