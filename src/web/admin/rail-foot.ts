/**
 * The foot: one strip of icon keys, and the owner's own menu at the end of it.
 *
 * It was six full-width rows carrying words — Collapse sidebar, Rearrange sidebar, Light, Hide
 * icons, Clear cache, Sign out — stacked under four destinations in a column where a full-width
 * row with a word in it is exactly what a PLACE looks like. "Light" was the clearest symptom:
 * read down the rail it is a page you can go to, and it is a theme. A control that fits in its
 * own glyph becomes one, they sit on ONE row instead of six, and the tooltip carries the word.
 *
 * TWO DID NOT BECOME GLYPHS, for the same reason: rearranging the rail and switching its icons
 * off are preferences somebody sets once and does not think about for a month, and an
 * unlabelled glyph for either would be a puzzle standing permanently on the screen. They are in
 * the owner's menu with Account and Sign out, which is where a tool's own settings are
 * looked for.
