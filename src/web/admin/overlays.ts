// THE THINGS THAT BELONG TO NO SCREEN, drawn once into the shell.
//
// The toast, the confirm dialog, the shortcut sheet and the command palette are the last of the
// admin that was React (ADR 0054, step 6). None of them is a page: they are answers a page asks
// for — `quire:toast`, `quire:confirm` — or chords the whole admin listens for. So they live in
// the shell, once, beside the canvas rather than inside it.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY FIXED PART IS DRAWN AND HIDDEN, as everywhere else in this admin. What is BUILT is
// only what is genuinely a list that changes: the toasts in the stack, and the palette's rows.
// The live regions in particular have to be in the document BEFORE they have anything to say —
// a screen reader watches regions it already knows about, and one that arrives carrying its
// message is a new element rather than a change to an old one.

 * a thing; what makes the grouping stop mattering is being able to type a word.
 *
 * NOTHING IS REPLACED. The rail stays, the tabs stay, the settings search stays. And it
 * NAVIGATES, IT DOES NOT SET: landing on the tab with the setting on it is honest about what
 * the index knows — a label and where it lives.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY ROW IS DRAWN. A hundred and twenty-odd of them, hidden, with their two search lanes
 * on the element: the island filters what is already here rather than building a list, which is
 * the rule the write column follows over forty-eight pieces. The two lanes come from
 * `src/accent.ts` and they are the Vietnamese rule in one place — an unaccented query finds
 * every accent, an accented one finds only itself. Folding both sides instead would make `lề`
