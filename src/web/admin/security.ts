// The account, which had no screen and no routes at all.
//
// `docs/spec/06-auth.md` has described "Settings → Security: change password, re-enrol 2FA,
// regenerate recovery codes, active session list with revoke" since the spec was written.
// None of it existed. Not a stale label — no route answered any of it, and the admin never
// asked. Meanwhile `listSessions`, `revokeAllSessions` and `remainingCodes` sat in
// `src/auth/`, written and tested, called by nothing: the third time this week a capability
// turned out to be finished and doorless (issue #60, then the per-piece analytics).
//
// What that cost, concretely: an owner whose laptop was stolen had no way to end its session,
// and an owner down to their last recovery code had no way to make more.
//
// THE PASSWORD IS THE KEY TO ALL OF IT. Every route here that changes something asks for the
// current password first — not as ceremony, but because a stolen session is exactly the
// threat these controls exist to answer, and a control that lets a stolen session rotate the
// 2FA secret hands the account over instead of taking it back.
