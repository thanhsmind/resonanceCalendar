// The sign-in screens carry the SOFTWARE's identity, not the blog's. That is a reversal of
// what 06-auth.md originally specified ("the site's own masthead"), decided by the owner
// after seeing the page: a reader never reaches /login, so the only person it speaks to is
// the one signing in to Quire Ink, and every install should show them the same door.
//
// ONE logo in two sizes, not a symbol plus a word: `Qi` where a five-letter word would be a
// smear (the app icon, the favicon, the collapsed rail), `quireINK` everywhere else. An
// abstract symbol used to sit beside the word here, and once the compact mark became the
// word's own initials, showing both read as a stutter.
//
// Inline SVG rather than a file: it must inherit `currentColor` so it survives a palette
// change and dark mode, and a logo that arrives on its own request can arrive late, on the
// one page where "did this load?" is a security question. OUTLINES rather than live text
// for the same reason plus two more: the admin renders in whatever chrome font the owner
// picked, and `pageStyles` declares only the owner's own faces, so a logo may not assume
// any given family is even present. The art lives in `@/brand-art`, which the admin shares.
