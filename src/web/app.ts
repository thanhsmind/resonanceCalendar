// Hono, not a framework: a route is a function from a request to a string, and the whole
// page cache is one Map (Invariant 1). What was ISR plus a tagged data cache plus a
// per-write path superset is now "render it, keep the string, throw all of them away on
// any write".
//
// Route order is load-bearing. `/:slug` matches anything, so every fixed path is
// registered before it; Hono matches in registration order.
