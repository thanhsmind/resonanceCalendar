// It is NOT a second content API. The fields here are the ones a reader's app needs to list
// an entry and open it; anything that wants the writing itself has the site, the RSS feed,
// or (when the owner switches it on) the content API. Keeping it to that is what stops this
// document quietly becoming an unversioned API somebody builds on.
//
// ⚠️ NO CHARACTER SWEEP HERE, and that is not an omission. RSS is XML, and XML 1.0 forbids
// a handful of characters outright — `feeds.ts` replaces them with a space because a feed
// carrying one is rejected WHOLE by a conforming reader. JSON forbids none of them:
// `JSON.stringify` escapes a control character, and since ES2019 it escapes a lone surrogate
// too, so the document it writes is always well-formed. Sweeping them here would mean the
// two feeds disagreed about what the owner wrote, which is a worse fault than a vertical tab.
