// The mobile sidebar must not pan sideways.
//
// This is a CSS test rather than a page test because the defect was not in any page: the
// drawer measured 299px of box against 331px of content on every phone, and nothing in the
// markup was wrong. Two separate mistakes had to line up for it, so there are two assertions.
//
// 1. `.rail` sets `overflow-y:auto` for a long index. A box that names ONE axis and leaves
//    the other alone does not get `visible` on the other: the used value computes to `auto`.
//    So the drawer was a horizontal scroller by accident, waiting for anything to be a pixel
//    too wide.
// 2. The IDE chrome then supplied that pixel. Its line-number ring hangs 23px outside the
//    row, on the gutter rail's divider hairline, and `.rail-inner` was widened and padded
//    back so the gutter's own `overflow-y:auto` could not clip it. Both of those are facts
//    about the DESKTOP rail. Ungated, they applied to a drawer that has no divider and no
//    inner scroller, and made it that much too wide.
