// The newspaper dialect (settings.look = 'paper'). Its own sheet, linked only when this
// look is on (`web/assets.ts`).
//
// This is the one dialect that TOUCHES THE READING COLUMN, and it does so on purpose: a
// paper numbers its sections, numbers its figures and its tables, and prints its byline
// under the headline rather than out in a margin. The source-code dialect's hard rule (never
// touch the column, `docs/conventions/looks.md`) exists because THAT look's argument is the
// contrast between a technical frame and an analogue text. This one's argument is that the
// whole page is a publication, so the rule does not carry over. What it still never does is
// change the reading face, the measure, or the words.
//
// AND IT CARRIES NO COLOUR. It carried seven palette tokens of its own for two releases, on
// the argument that a newspaper is a material: ink on newsprint, and inheriting whichever
// palette an owner happened to pick meant a paper printed in forest green. The owner
// settled it the other way on 2026-09-13, and the rule is now flat: THE PALETTE IS THE ONLY
// SOURCE OF COLOUR ON THIS SITE. Six palettes in a menu, four of which did nothing on this
// look, is a control that lies — measured: with the dialect on, choosing Mono, Sepia or
// Forest changed not one pixel, because `html[data-look=paper]` outranks `[data-palette=x]`.
// A look sets shape, type and marks; what colour those come out in is the reader's.
//
// The SHELF lives in `look-paper-shelf.css.ts` and is concatenated back on at the foot of
// this file: one sheet reaches the page, and every guard still reads one string. It was cut
// out when this file passed the 400-line cap, by subject rather than by size.
//
// NO BACKTICKS anywhere below: this is one template literal and a backtick ends it.
// `check:css-literal` enforces that, and this file is IN its list.

/* --- THE MASTHEAD -----------------------------------------------------------
   A paper announces itself once, in the middle: the name, then one line carrying the
   strapline in the centre and the reader's controls at the right end of it, then the
   sections, then a heavy rule closing the lot.

   A GRID, and that is what puts the controls on the strapline's line. They cannot share a
   row in a column flex: the name, the section menu and the controls live inside .site-bar
   while the strapline is its sibling, so the four become siblings only once the bar's own
   box is dropped - and in a column every sibling then takes a row of its own. Explicit
   placement also stops the DOM order mattering: the controls are written third and sit on
   the second row.

   THE CONTROLS USED TO BE ABSOLUTE, pinned to the top right corner, and that is what this
   replaces. On a masthead whose every other part is centred they hung in the corner with
   nothing opposite them, higher up the page than the name itself; on an article, which
   carries no section menu, they sat alone above 90px of empty white.

   '1fr auto 1fr' keeps the strapline centred on the PAGE rather than in what the controls
   leave of it: the outer columns stay equal whatever those controls measure, so the
   strapline sits on the same axis as the name above it. Measured at 1440: name centre
   720.0, strapline centre 720.0.

   'margin-inline:0' on the name is load-bearing: in the bar's own flex ROW it carries
   'margin-right:auto' to push the controls to the far end, and once the bar's box is gone
   that auto margin ate 917px of the column and pinned the name to the left edge while the
   strapline under it sat centred. */
