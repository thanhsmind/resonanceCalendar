/**
 * ⚠️ CHARACTERS XML FORBIDS OUTRIGHT, which no escape can rescue.
 *
 * XML 1.0 admits tab, newline, carriage return and then nothing below `\u0020`. Everything
 * else in that range — a vertical tab, a form feed, an escape, a NUL — is not a character the
 * format has a spelling for, and neither is half a surrogate pair or `\uFFFE`. A document
 * holding one is rejected WHOLE by a conforming reader: not the item, the feed.
 *
 * So one post whose title carries a stray `\u000B` stops every subscriber's reader updating,
 * and the owner sees nothing wrong — HTML takes the same character without complaint, so the
 * post's own page looks perfect. Measured 2026-09-19: eight such characters in `/feed.xml`
 * from four posts. They arrive by import (old exports and anything pasted out of a word
 * processor carry them), over MCP, and off a clipboard.
 *
 * A SPACE, not a deletion: `\u000B` stands where a break was meant, and dropping it joins the
 * two words either side of it into one.
