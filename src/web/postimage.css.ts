// NO BACKTICKS anywhere: this is one template literal and a backtick ends it.
// `check:css-literal` enforces that, and this file is IN its list — the mistake `prose.css`
// made was being split out without being added.
//
// The shapes are read from `data-` attributes rather than from classes, because the shape
// is a SETTING: a page rendered while `thumb` was `side` sits in the cache with its markup
// already written, and a class would have baked the old answer into it. The attribute is
// written by the same render, but the CSS that acts on it is not — so the two shapes cost
// one selector each and nothing has to be re-rendered when the setting moves.

/* --- the hero, above an article ------------------------------------------------
   The reading column, and no wider. A breakout version existed for one afternoon
   and was measured out of existence: the rails sit eight pixels from the column and
   travel with it, so anything wider prints the picture over the table of contents.
   render/rail-css.ts reached the same answer for in-body pictures before this.

   3:2, ALWAYS, and it is not a question the owner is asked. One blog's covers should
   look like one blog's covers, and the shape doing that job belongs to the design.
   Fixing it also removes the case that made a chooser look necessary: an ordinary
   977x1400 portrait scan is 963px tall inside a 672px column, a whole screen of
   picture standing between the headline and the first sentence.

   The ratio pins the box, so the space is reserved before the file arrives, and
   object-fit crops the overflow rather than squashing the photograph. The 70vh cap
   stays underneath as a floor for a very wide reading column, where even 3:2 is tall. */

/* --- the thumbnail, on a list row ----------------------------------------------
   'side' turns the card into a two-column grid; the words keep their order in the
   markup and the picture is placed, so a screen reader and a no-CSS reader both get
   the headline first. A phone drops back to one column: 96px of picture beside a
   headline at 375px leaves the headline nowhere to go. */
/* CROPPED, ALWAYS, and the shape is not a setting.
   A gallery gets to choose because a gallery IS the photographs; a list thumbnail is
   chrome, and its job is recognition. Measured with three real files on 2026-08-29 —
   ratios 0.70, 2.10 and 0.72 — an uncropped column read as a tall block, a thin strip
   and a tall block, which is not a list. The aspect-ratio also reserves the box before
   the file lands: every thumbnail measured height 0 until then. */

/* FLOATED, not a grid column. A two-column grid pins the words beside the picture for the
   whole card, so a 96px square against four lines of standfirst leaves a hole under the
   picture and the row reads as a table with an empty cell. Floating lets the text run past
   the picture and close up underneath it, which is what the space is for.

   'flow-root' contains the float: without it a card shorter than its own picture would let
   the picture hang into the card below. It does not clip, so the timeline marker — absolutely
   positioned out in the gutter by rail-css.ts — is untouched. */

/* THE STANDFIRST STARTS UNDER THE PICTURE, not beside it, and this is the half the rule above
   got wrong. It assumed four lines would run past the picture and close up; what actually sits
   beside a 96px square is the kind line and the headline, and the standfirst gets one or two
   lines before the float ends. Measured at 1440 on 2026-09-12: one card ran two lines at 529.6
   and then dropped to 416, another ran a SINGLE line at 529.6 before dropping — a paragraph
   whose left edge steps 113.6px in the middle of itself, which reads as a mistake rather than
   as a wrap. Clearing it costs the white beside a one-line headline and buys every line of
   every standfirst on the front page one left edge. */

/* A PHONE GETS A GRID, NOT A FLOAT. Beside a floated picture the kind line wrapped to three

   pen, in Van / Gogh's letters") — measured at 390 on 2026-09-23 on the home, category and tag
   pages. Two columns hold the picture to the right of the kind line and the headline, each of
   which now has one left edge, and the standfirst runs the full width beneath them. */
