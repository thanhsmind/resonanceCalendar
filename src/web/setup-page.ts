// First run, after the account: the only four questions worth interrupting somebody for.
//
// The list of what is NOT here is the design. Palettes, fonts, book mode, the feature
// switches — none of them belongs in a wizard, because nobody can judge them before the site
// has a single post on it. Asking is asking a person to pick the binding for a book they
// have not written, and a choice made blind is worse than a default: a default still reads
// as "not decided yet", while something you clicked reads as decided. Those live on the
// dashboard's "first five minutes" card, which is re-openable, which is the right shape for
// them: a choice you can return to is a choice you can safely postpone.
//
// What is left qualifies on one of three grounds. The site address and the time zone are
// WRONG BY DEFAULT AND SILENT ABOUT IT — one makes every feed, sitemap and share card say
// `localhost:3000`, the other makes every date on the site read in the server's timezone —
// and the browser happens to know both. The front page is the one honest coin-flip: it
// decides what `/` even is.
//
// The reader's pen (2026-09-11) is the third, and it is not a taste question like the ones
// ruled out above. It is the only switch on this software that changes what OTHER PEOPLE may
// do on your pages, and it is the thing Quire Ink has that the blog you came from does not
// (ADR 0043) — an owner who never opens Settings never learns it is there. So it is asked
// once, with the answer it already has, and one click in Settings undoes the asking.
//
// The dialect (2026-09-13) is the fourth, and it looks at first like exactly the taste
// question ruled out above. It is not, and the difference is what the question ASKS. A
// palette or a typeface asks you to judge a thing you have not seen on writing you have not
// done. This asks what you are about to write — which you know before you have written a
// word, and which is the only fact the four dialects differ on. It is also the one setting
// here that a screenshot carries whole, so an owner who never opens Settings would never
// learn that their blog could have looked like anything else.
//
// LAST, and that is also where the run is finished and the release stamped: a blog that has
// answered this has been asked, and the admin's what's-new panel must never ask it again.
