/* Scroll reveal: a card eases in as it enters the viewport. This is what the owner meant
   by the fade at the foot of the feed going missing - the markup has carried a .reveal
   class since M2 and NO rule ever matched it, so the cards simply appeared.

   GUARDED FOUR ways, and it may only ever HIDE content where it can also reveal it: the
   owner's switch (data-scroll-fade), view() timelines, motion on, and no reduced-motion
   preference. Anything else leaves .reveal a normal, fully visible element, so there is no
   blank-page failure mode.

   ⚠️ entry 0% -> entry 100%, and the range is the whole fix. It was cover 20%, and cover is
   measured against the card's OWN height plus the window: on a feed of long posts that is a
   long way further up the page, so cards sat half faded in the MIDDLE of the window while
   shorter cards beside them were solid. entry 100% is one instant with one meaning at any
   height — the card is inside the window — so a card you can read is never still arriving.

   A fixed distance (entry 320px) was tried and is worse: inside an entry range a length is measured
   along a range that is only as long as the card, so on a short card the animation never
   reaches its end at all and the card stays permanently dimmed. */
/* ⚠️ NO FILL ON EITHER SCROLL-DRIVEN FADE, and it is the difference between an effect that
   fails to happen and a page that cannot be read. A scroll-driven animation's value is written
   in the frame; when the frame is late — a long task on the main thread, or a range an engine
   resolved once and never resolved again — the element goes on painting the animation's FILL.
   Measured in headless Chrome on 2026-09-20 by reading style after a scroll with no frame in
   between: with the both keyword, running text came back at opacity 0.35 and three cards at
   opacity 0, which is a card with real height, real gaps around it and no words in it. Without
   it, 1. That is the state reported three times and patched three times from the other end.

   And the fill was buying nothing. Both ranges end where the element stops being visible:
   outside cover 0%..100% the block has not touched the window or has already left it, and past
   entry 100% the animation's own end — opacity 1, no transform — IS the base rule. So the fill
   only ever described the page in a state nobody can see, and painted it over the page in the
   one state everybody can. The bar above lost its fill in the same pass, where the keyword was
   merely inert — its range is normal, so there is no before or after phase to fill, and its
   from is its base rule; measured at five scroll positions, its scale is identical to six
   places with the keyword and without it. It goes because check:motion-drift keeps this rule
   with no exemption list, and an exemption list is how the first three fixes wore off. */

/* THE SAME EFFECT ON AN ARTICLE, which is the other half of the owner's one switch: the
   running text dims as it reaches the top and the bottom of the window and is solid in
   between, so the paragraph being read is the brightest thing on the screen.

   Per BLOCK rather than as one gradient over the column: a fixed overlay would have to know
   the column's width, its background and the theme, and would sit over the sidebar on the
   way. A block that is taller than the window never dims — cover cannot reach its ends —
   which is the correct behaviour: a long code listing is not "arriving" while you read it.

   Only direct children of .prose, and never the figures: an image dimming at the edges
   reads as a rendering fault rather than as an effect.

   ⚠️ NOT IN THE SPREAD. The desktop book's flow IS a .prose, and it is laid out in columns
   that run sideways — so a view() timeline, which only knows the document's vertical scroll,
   dimmed whichever paragraphs happened to sit outside the window in a direction the reader
   is not scrolling. On a phone that put a wash of grey across the top of every page turned.

   The PHONE reader is the opposite case and gets the effect: it scrolls the document like
   any other page, and the fade is what stops a line being sliced in half by the top of the
   glass — which is what the edge of a scrolling window does to a line of type, and what a
   paginated reader never has to answer for. */
