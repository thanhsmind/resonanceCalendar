// the search, which is the only reason this exists as a page at all.
//
// NOT cached, deliberately: the key would be the query string, which is unbounded, and a
// cache an anonymous visitor can fill is a memory leak with a nicer name. That is also why
// it needs the cap below — an uncached FTS5 query anybody can issue in a loop, on a runtime
// with one thread, is a lever on the whole site rather than on one page.

// Reproduced against a local instance before this line was written; there is a test for it.
