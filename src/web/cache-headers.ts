// What a SHARED cache may do with a page. One rule, at the door.
//
// Nothing was sent at all, and the CDN in front of this decides for itself what that means:
// a staging article came back from the edge two deploys stale, and an hour went into
// chasing a bug that had already been fixed. On the live domain the same thing is a
// published post nobody can see.
//
// This is about the SHARED cache only. The in-process page cache is a different thing with
// a different rule — Invariant 1, cleared completely after every write — and it is exact
// where this is a window.

 * readers costs one render. `stale-while-revalidate` is what keeps the refresh off the
 * reader's critical path: the first request after expiry is answered from the stale copy
 * and the edge fetches a new one behind it.
 *
 * EXPORTED because the Content API answers with the same freshness (ADR 0057): it is the same
 * published content, purged by the same write, and a second window written out beside this one
 * is two answers to one question waiting to disagree.
