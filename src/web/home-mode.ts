// The branch lives here rather than in `app.ts` for two reasons. The obvious one is size:
// `app.ts` is a route table and was already near its 400-line cap. The real one is that
// NEITHER of these decisions can be made when the routes are registered. `createApp()` runs
// once, at boot, and the owner changes the mode at runtime — so a route table built from
// settings would need a restart to take effect, and would silently serve the old shape until
// it got one. Both branches are therefore resolved per request, inside routes that already
// exist: `/` and the `/{slug}` catch-all.
