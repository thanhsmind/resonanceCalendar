// WHAT AN ARTICLE PAGE'S HEAD SAYS — title, description, canonical, card, schema, language.

// Split out of `article.ts` on 2026-09-19, when that file reached its 400-line ceiling. The
// seam is between what a page IS and what it SAYS ABOUT ITSELF: everything left in `article.ts`
// assembles the article a reader sees, and this assembles the block only a crawler, a scraper
// and a screen reader ever read. They meet at one call.
