/**
 * Where to go after signing in.
 *
 * Only a same-site ABSOLUTE PATH is honoured. A full URL here is the open-redirect that
 * turns a trustworthy sign-in page into a link an attacker can send: sign in on the real
 * site, get bounced somewhere else. `//evil.example` is rejected too — the browser reads a
 * protocol-relative URL as another origin, and it starts with a slash. `/\evil.example` is
 * the same trick against a check that only knows about slashes: browsers normalise the
 * backslash and leave the site just as readily. `safeReturnPath` in `web/comment-auth.ts`
 * guards the identical pair, for the identical reason.
 *
 * And no control characters or whitespace ANYWHERE in it. The URL parser strips ASCII tab
 * and newline before it reads a URL, so `/<TAB>/evil.example` passes both checks above and
 * still arrives in the browser as `//evil.example`. Reproduced 2026-09-02: the server sent
 * `Location: /\t/example.com` for `?next=/%09/example.com`, and Chrome resolved it to
 * `https://example.com/`. A backslash later in the path is refused for the same reason.
