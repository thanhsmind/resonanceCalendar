// Compressing text responses.
//
// `Bun.serve` sends what the handler returns, byte for byte, and nothing here ever set
// `content-encoding` — so every page, stylesheet, bundle and feed left the origin
// uncompressed. Measured: the public stylesheet is 45,269 bytes on the wire and 14,207
// gzipped, and an article page is around 25 KB of HTML that compresses to roughly a fifth.
//
// The CDN re-compresses on its way to the reader, so this is not what a reader downloads;
// it is the origin-to-edge hop, which is a transatlantic fetch on every cache miss and on
// every one of the purges this release just started issuing. It is also what a reader gets
// if the CDN is ever bypassed or removed.
//
// Only text, only when it is worth it, and only when the client asked. An image, a font or
// a WebP variant is already compressed and running gzip over it spends CPU to add bytes.
//
// BROTLI FIRST, gzip behind it. This file used to say gzip only, on two grounds that were
// re-measured on 2026-09-01 and did not survive.
//
// The first was that brotli saves 2.9% on an article page. That is true at quality 4, which
// is the worst rung on the whole ladder: q4 saves 1.4% on this build's article page, q5
// saves 7.7% and is FASTER (0.5 ms against 0.7), and q11 saves 17.6%. The three immutable
// sheets are where it stops being a rounding error, because they are SVG data-URIs by the
// hundred and brotli has a window wide enough to see the repetition: pen-marks.css goes
// 11,838 → 5,928 bytes (-50%) and pen-lines.css 8,664 → 5,368 (-38%). Over one cold visit to
// a post carrying the pen, the six text responses fall from 49,960 bytes to 36,717 (-27%).
//
// The second was that the CDN re-compresses anyway, so the reader never sees the difference.
// Half true, and the wrong half. Measured against a live install behind Cloudflare: the HTML
// came back `content-encoding: zstd`, so that hop is indeed re-done — but
// `/assets/site.<hash>.css` came back `cf-cache-status: HIT, content-encoding: gzip,
// content-length: 10907`, byte for byte the origin's own gzip, passed straight through. The
// immutable assets are exactly the ones every first-time reader downloads, and they were
// keeping the worse encoding. An install with no CDN in front of it kept the worse encoding
// for everything.
//
// The CPU objection is answered by the cache below rather than by choosing a weak quality:
// a body is compressed once per encoding and served from the map forever after, so q11 on a
// sheet that never changes is paid once in the life of the process. Only the qualities that
// would be paid per DISTINCT body are held down, which is why HTML gets q5.
//
// zstd is deliberately not offered. Measured on the same six responses it saves 18% against
// brotli's 27%, and Safari does not send it at all.
