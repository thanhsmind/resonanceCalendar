// EVERY CONTROL THAT ANSWERS A POINTER ALSO ANSWERS A FINGER, or is written down as not.
//
// `motion.css.ts` states the rule in one line — "the click, for everything a finger can
// press" — and then enumerates the controls by hand underneath it. Nothing compared the two.
// Measured on 2026-09-20: five boxes had a hover and no press at all (the overlay's close
// key, the phone's book key, the quote's copy pill, the book toolbar's size keys, the pen
// bar's keys), one press was painted in ink nobody could see, and one carve landed on a
// button with no box.
//
// So the two lists live here instead, and a control with a `:hover` rule that is in neither
// fails this file until somebody decides which it is. Adding a name to PRESSES is a line;
// adding one to NO_PRESS costs a reason, which is the asymmetry that keeps the rule honest.
