// Prerender the next page on hover. The largest perceived-speed win available to a reading
// site, and it costs no runtime JavaScript: the browser does the work, on its own budget,
// and a click then paints a document that is already rendered.
//
// The spec asked for this (docs/spec/04-frontend.md, "two zero-JavaScript wins") and
// docs/performance.md described it as already shipping. It was not: the port carried over
// `whenActivated` — the guard that exists ONLY because a prerendered page runs its JS at
// speculation time — and never the rules that make the guard necessary.
//
// **Delivered as a header, not as an inline script.** The frozen tree put ten lines of JSON
// in the head. 2.0 ships no inline script on the public site, which is what lets the
// recommended CSP omit `unsafe-inline` from `script-src`, and an inline speculationrules
// block is governed by `script-src` like any other. The `Speculation-Rules` response header
// points at a JSON document instead, so the invariant holds and the CSP stays clean.

 * A link worth speculating on, for either rule.

 * nobody asked for. `nofollow` and `download` are the author saying so in the markup.
 *
 * `/search` is the one that is not obvious, and it is the most expensive of them. The
 * header's search control is an `<a href="/search">` so that it works without JavaScript,
 * which put the one HTML route that is deliberately never cached, renders the sidebar and
 * is rate limited at 60 requests a minute per address inside an EAGER prefetch on every
 * public page. A reader paging quickly, or an office behind one address, spent that budget
 * on pages nobody asked for and then met a 429 on the real thing.

/**
 * Two rules, because prefetch and prerender do not cost the same thing.
 *
 * `moderate` alone was not enough, and the reason is arithmetic. It starts a prerender only
 * after the pointer has RESTED on a link ~200ms, which a normal hover-and-click never gives:
 * measured from a Vietnamese home connection 2026-07-31, TTFB through the CDN is ~145ms on an
 * edge hit and ~185ms on a miss, so the speculation is still in flight when the click lands.
 * It also does nothing on a touch screen, where there is no hover.
 *
 * So the HTML is fetched ahead of the click for every link. `prefetch` is bytes only — no
 * render, no JavaScript — and a page is ~20 KB gzipped the origin already holds warm. The
 * reader pays that round trip before deciding, which is the point.
 *
 * `prerender` stays on `moderate`: it is a full document plus its JavaScript, and at `eager` a
 * reader who scrolls past ten cards has paid for ten. Hover is a real signal of intent and
 * earns that cost; being in the viewport is not.
 *
 * The cost of `eager` prefetch, stated honestly: a listing with twenty links pulls roughly
 * 400 KB it may never use. Chrome caps prefetch at fifty documents and drops it under Save-Data.
