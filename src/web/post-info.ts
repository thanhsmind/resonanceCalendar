// The post info panel: the date, the length, the way into book mode and the taxonomy, in
// the RIGHT gutter of an article — the half of the page that had nothing in it.
//
// It exists only above the rail breakpoint. Below it there is no gutter to put anything in,
// so the panel is `display:none` and the in-flow originals (the meta line above the title,
// the taxonomy over a rule at the end) are what the reader gets, exactly as before. That is
// the reason the same facts are in the markup twice: at any one width precisely one copy
// has a box, so a screen reader is never read the date twice. The listing sidebar already
// does this for the mobile drawer (`drawer-only`).
//
// It does NOT scroll with the article. A sticky panel would ride down the gutter and sit on
// top of any wide image or video, which noses out into that same gutter by one rail width.
// So it stands at the top of the article and leaves with it.
//
// One line per fact, not the meta line's run of middots: 250px is too narrow for
// "date · 4,160 words · 21 min" and the wrap lands mid-phrase. Stacked, it reads as what it
// is — a properties panel.
