// Owner-managed redirects, answered before anything renders.
//
// The rows have been stored since the port and nothing served them: a redirect created in
// Settings → SEO appeared in the list and did nothing, and — the expensive half — every
// slug rename auto-added a 301 that never fired, so renaming a post silently threw away
// its old URL and whatever ranked at it.
//
// The frozen tree resolved these in Next's `middleware.ts` because a page-level
// `redirect()` under a route with a `loading.tsx` was downgraded to a 200 meta-refresh.
// Hono has no such rule, but "a moved URL answers with a real 301 before anything renders"
// is the behaviour rather than the workaround, so it is still resolved ahead of the router:
// a redirect whose source is also a live listing (`/category/old`) has to win, and it only
// wins from here. Live CONTENT cannot be shadowed either way, and three places hold that:
// `clearRedirectForPath` deletes any row whose source is a slug content is SAVED at, the
// same call runs when a trashed row is RESTORED, and `saveRedirect` refuses a source that
// live content already holds.
