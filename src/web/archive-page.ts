// `/archive`: every published post on one page, newest year first.
//
// The blog had no surface that showed the whole of itself in time order. A reader could
// reach an old post through a tag, through search, or by paging back through the feed one
// screen at a time — measured on a 100-post blog, the eleventh page of the listing. None of
// those answers "what has this person written", which is the question somebody who just
// found the site is actually asking.
//
// One page, not `/archive/2024` per year. A year route would mint a URL per year with a
// dozen rows on it and split the one view that is worth having; the years here are anchors
// instead, so the jump row at the top costs no request. The rows are deliberately thin —
// date and title, no excerpt, no thumbnail — because 200 of them have to stay scannable and
// the excerpt is what the listing page is for.
