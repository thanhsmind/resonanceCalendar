// The public stylesheet, hand-written (ADR 0008: no Tailwind on the public site).
//
// It is a string rather than a `.css` file because it is ASSEMBLED — hand-written in pieces
// that compose in a deliberate order (see the bottom of this file), minified once and served
// from one hashed, immutable path by `assets.ts`. It was inlined into every page until
// 2026-07-30, when measuring three articles showed 41 KB of gzipped CSS re-sent for one
// page's worth of information; the static half moved to a cached file and only the
// settings-derived half stays inline. Re-measured 2026-08-28 on a throttled phone, in case
// the round trip had become the worse half again: it has not. Linked is 616 ms to first
// paint and inlining the whole sheet back into the HTML is 660 ms, because the preload
// scanner starts the sheet while the HTML is still streaming, so the request is free while
// the extra 45 KB in the document is not.
//
// Writing it by hand is what keeps it small enough for either answer to be on the table: a
// utility framework's output cannot be inlined without shipping the parts this site does
// not use.
//
// Every colour comes from a theme token (`--c-*`, set by `themesToCss`) and every size
// from a type role (`--fs-*`, set by `typographyToCss`). No hardcoded hex, no hardcoded
// px sizes: that rule survives from the frozen tree's conventions and is what keeps the
// palette switcher and the typography settings actually wired to something.

   sets its palette down to the hairline and then hands the most physical gesture a reader
   makes — dragging across a sentence — to the operating system's accent. Ink on paper is
   what the rest of the page already is, and inverted it reads like a marker.

   paragraph. The mid-grey reads as a mark; the text on it stays the page's own ground.
   Three selectors and not one, for the same reason content/themes.ts writes three: the
   island sets .dark and data-scheme, and before it runs, a reader whose SYSTEM is dark
   is on the dark palette with neither attribute set. Without the media query that reader

 * `book.css.ts` gives that same button its size with `.icon-btn{display:flex}`: one class
