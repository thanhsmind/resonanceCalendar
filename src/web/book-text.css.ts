// How book mode SETS the words: the indent, the justification, and the baseline grid.

// Split from `book.css.ts` for the reason that file was split from `islands.css.ts` — it
// reached the 400-line ceiling — and the seam is the one the subject already draws: that
// file is the overlay's CHROME (the panel, the arrows, the spine, the drop cap, the page
// count), this one is the type inside it.
//
// `public.css.ts` interpolates it immediately after `BOOK_CSS`, so nothing below it in the
// cascade changed hands.
//
// NO BACKTICKS anywhere below: this is one template literal and a backtick ends it.
// `check:css-literal` enforces that.

/* THE OVERLAY SETS ITS OWN TEXT, and this is the half that was missing.
   This sheet opens by saying book mode keeps its OWN standard rather than the site's, and
   it kept it for paper, ink, the drop cap, the asterism and the spine. The WORDS were left
   to features.bookText, which is a setting about the scrolling article and is off on a
   fresh install. Measured on a blog that had not turned it on: a spread with a drop cap, a
   centre spine and an asterism, setting its paragraphs ragged, unindented and unhyphenated,
   which is a web page cut into pages. The indent is what tells a reader a paragraph
   CONTINUES when there is no blank line to say so, and on a paged column there is none. */
/* TWO EMS, up from 1.6 on 2026-09-14. A paragraph break on a paged column is the indent
   and nothing else — there is no blank line to add and no room for one on a baseline grid —
   so the indent is the ONLY thing saying a new paragraph has started, and at 1.6em over a
   57-character justified measure it was saying it under its breath. Two ems is the top of
   the range a printed book uses and about four characters here. */

/* A CODE LINE HAS NOWHERE TO SCROLL ON A PAGE, so it wraps instead of being cut off.
   The scrolling article gives a wide block overflow-x:auto and the reader pans it, which is
   fine on a page that already moves under the finger. A paged column does not move: measured
   on 2026-09-12, one block hid 126px of a 690px line at 1440 and 294px at 949, and the only
   thing on screen saying so was a 2px overlay scrollbar in a reading surface where every
   other gesture turns the page. Wrapping shows every character; break-word is for the one
   long unbroken token (a path, a URL) that no space can fold. */

/* THE BASELINE GRID, which is the thing a printed book has and a column of HTML does not.
   Two columns of a spread only read as one page if their lines sit at the same heights, and
   that holds only while every gap between blocks is a whole number of lines. Measured at
   1440 before this rule: the line is 31.32px, a paragraph gap was 58px (1.85 lines), and
   heading gaps were 67 and 42 (2.14 and 1.34). So the left column and the right column went
   out of phase at the first paragraph break and drifted from there.

   A paragraph therefore leads with NOTHING but its indent, which is what a book does and
   what leaves the gap at exactly one line. A heading's own line box is set to whole lines of
   the body: a heading whose leading is not a multiple of the text's leading knocks
   everything under it off the grid, however tidy its own margins are.

   ⚠️ THE HEADING'S AIR IS INSIDE ITS LINE BOX, not all in its margins, and that is what
   makes the section breaks stop shouting. It used to be two lines of margin above, a
   one-line box, and one line below: four line-slots, and 81px of white above the words
   against 34px below, on a page whose paragraphs are separated by an indent and nothing
   else. Reported from a published spread, 2026-09-14 — the gaps between sections read as
   the loudest thing on the page.

   One line of margin and a TWO-line box now: the face sits in the middle of its own air, so
   the reader gets about a line and a half above the words and half a line below, in three
   slots rather than four. Above still beats below, which is this admin's rule about what a
   heading belongs to, and every gap is still a whole number of lines — which is the only
   thing keeping the two columns of a spread in phase. h1 already took a two-line box,
   because 2em of face does not fit in one. */

/* A PICTURE IS A PLATE, AND ITS CAPTION BELONGS TO IT. The caption sits 8px under the
   picture and the text resumed ONE line after the caption — which, now that a paragraph
   break costs nothing but an indent, is the same distance as the gap between two ordinary
   paragraphs. So the caption glued itself to the words underneath and read as their opening
   line. Two lines each side, so the plate stands clear and still lands on whole lines.
   ⚠️ Its own rule rather than a name in the list above: :is() takes the specificity of its
   most specific argument, so that list carries the CLASS in .table-scroll and outranks a
   plain figure element — which is why two lines here looked like one until it was measured. */
