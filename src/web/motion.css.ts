// THE MOTION ENGINE of the reading site. One file holds everything that decides HOW the
// site moves; the sheets that own a component keep only WHAT moves (which property, which
// state). Its twin in script is src/assets/js/motion.ts, and the admin has the same shape
// at the foot of src/admin/admin.css. docs/conventions/motion.md is the contract.
//
// Four parts, in the order the cascade needs them:
//   1. the tokens - three durations and ONE curve;
//   2. the floor - every pressable thing eases its colour at the same speed, so nothing snaps
//      beside a neighbour that eases (the admin measured 92 such controls before it got one);
//   3. the click and the entrances - a press lands NOW and springs back, a menu or a dialog
//      arrives rather than appears;
//   4. the two gates - the owner's switch and the reader's OS preference, each one rule.
//
// Cheap properties only: opacity, transform (and the independent translate), colour, shadow.
// Nothing here animates a layout property, and nothing here may HIDE content it cannot
// reveal: an entrance starts from the visible state where the engine is unsupported.
//
// NO BACKTICKS anywhere below, comments included: check:css-literal.

/**
 * The tokens, exported on their own because the sign-in page is served pageStyles +
 * LOGIN_CSS and not the public sheet: it takes this line and the gates, and nothing else.
 *
 * --ease-out is the one curve, and it was introduced only once a real curve had been chosen
 * rather than to complete a set: it is the FLIP the admin rail uses to slide a row, and the
 * same fast-out settle every entrance below shares. The scroll-driven animations do not use
 * it and must not: a timeline a reader scrubs with a thumb is linear or it is wrong.

/* THE FLOOR. Every control answers a pointer at the same speed. :where() on purpose: it
   makes this selector specificity ZERO, so any rule a component states for itself wins
   outright - the to-top button keeps its opacity fade, the rail its slide. Only the
   properties a hover or a focus actually changes, never all: transitioning layout is how a
   list starts sliding about when a row is added.
   ⚠️ var(--ease-out), NOT the keyword ease. The floor predates the token and kept the browser
   default for a year after a curve had been chosen; the admin's own floor had drifted further
   still, to cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1) - the framework default, which is a different curve
   again. Three curves were doing one job (2026-09-20). One is the whole point of a token. */

/* THE CLICK, for everything a finger can press. Pressing lands at once - the 1px of travel
   and the carved-in shadow arrive with transition-duration:0 - and only the release is
   sprung, on whatever transition the control already carries (the floor, for most). A
   control that eases both ways feels like a screen; a key that drops now and springs back
   is what a hand expects of a pressed thing. With motion off and under reduced motion the
   shadow stays and the travel goes: the state must still be legible without the movement,
   so relief is never the only cue.

   THE LIST WAS HAND-KEPT AND HAD DRIFTED (2026-09-20). "Everything a finger can press" was
   the rule in this comment and an enumeration underneath it, and five boxes had never been
   added: the overlay's close key (a 2rem round key that fills with --c-rule, which is
   .icon-btn's own shape and fill), the phone's book key, the quote's copy pill, the book
   toolbar's size keys, and the pen bar's keys. Each one answered a pointer and then took a
   click in silence.

   ⚠️ A CARVE NEEDS A BOX. The controls left out below are not oversights: .pen-del,
   .pen-send, .comment-reply and .comment-signout have padding:0 and no surface - they are
   words, underlined or not, and a shadow across a word is a smudge. They answer with colour,
   which is what a word can do. .pen-swatch is left out for the opposite reason: its
   box-shadow IS its ring, and a second inset would fight the first. .book-arrow keeps its
   centring (colour only) and .resume-pill composes its own. */

/* THE ENTRANCES. A menu or a dialog ARRIVES: it starts a shade transparent and a few pixels
   short of its place and settles on the one curve. Pure CSS, from the @starting-style the
   browser applies on the frame an element first appears, so the islands stay as they are -
   hidden = true and showModal() are still the whole of the script. An engine without
   @starting-style or allow-discrete simply shows and hides instantly, which is the state
   every rule below starts from, so nothing can be left invisible.

   Opacity ONLY on a dialog. A transform on it would make the dialog the containing block
   for anything fixed inside it during the entrance, and the element would jump when the
   transform came off. The menu is small and owns no fixed child, so it may also travel. */

   appeared (2026-09-20). Every other surface that hides itself arrives - the dialog, its
   backdrop, the theme and palette menus, the quote's copy key - and the bar that opens over a
   selection, the one surface a reader summons by hand, snapped into place.
   IT RISES, where the menu descends: the bar is placed ABOVE the selection it belongs to
   (below it only when there is no room), so it starts under its place and settles up into it.
   The script sets left/top and nothing else, so translate is free.
