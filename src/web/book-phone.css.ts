/* THE PHONE'S READER: the same paper, scrolled instead of turned (book-scroll.ts).
   It is not a dialog, so the DOCUMENT scrolls — which is the whole point, because iOS only
   retracts its address bar and toolbar while the page itself is moving. Measured on an
   iPhone at 844px: Safari kept 190px and the reader's own bar another 56, so the words had
   under 600 and a nineteen-page article turned a page every four sentences.
   The page's own content is hidden by one rule rather than by touching every element, so
   closing the reader restores the page with nothing to remember. */
/* THE GROUND BEHIND SAFARI'S OWN BARS IS THE PAPER, and that is the whole of this rule.
   iOS paints the status bar's strip, and the area its address bar retracts from, with the
   document's background - the site's page colour, white on the default palette - not with
   whatever element happens to be under it. So the reader had a white band above its paper
   on an iPhone, exactly where an ordinary page shows none, because an ordinary page IS
   white there. The reader is paper to the top of the glass only if the document is. The
   island also sets theme-color to the same stock while the reader is open (book-scroll.ts),
   which is what Safari reads first when it is present. */
