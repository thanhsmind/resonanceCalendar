// Turning ONE chosen pigment into the four values the pen actually needs.

// The built-in inks are measured off a photograph and hand-tuned per colour (ADR 0018), and
// they stay exactly as they are. This file is for the OTHER case, added 2026-08-24 when the
// pen's colours became a setting: somebody picks one hex, and the
// stroke still has to work on a dark page and still has to have a line version, because a
// 2px underline drawn in a pale highlighter pigment is invisible.
//
// The dark-stroke rule is not invented here. It is read back off the built-ins: green, pink,
// blue and orange are each exactly their light pigment at 45% over the dark page, which is
// the mix ADR 0018 settled on as "the brightest at which all five clear 5.0:1". (Yellow is
// the one exception, warmed by hand so it does not read as the green at dark luminance —
// which is precisely the kind of judgement a formula cannot make and a measured default can
// keep.) The line rules are looser: they land a chosen colour in the right family rather
// than reproducing a hand-picked value, and they only ever apply to a colour somebody chose.
