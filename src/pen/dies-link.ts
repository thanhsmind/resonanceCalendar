// The link's dashes: the pen's fourth gesture, and the only one the WRITER never asks for.
//
// SPLIT OUT OF `pen-dies.ts` when that file passed its 400-line ceiling, and the seam is a
// real one rather than a convenient cut. Every die in that file is a mark somebody chose to
// make on a page and is dealt by a hash of the text under it; this one is furniture, applied
// to every link by the stylesheet. They are also delivered differently: the writer's
// gestures ride in the two sheets that only board pages carrying a mark or an underline
// (ADR 0027), while this rides in `prose.css.ts` because a link is on nearly every page.
//
// ITS OWN SEED, and that is the load-bearing part of the split. `pen-dies.ts` draws every
// die from one PRNG stream, in order, and its comments warn that new gestures must be
// APPENDED so the existing ones do not reshuffle. Sharing that stream across two modules
// would make the order depend on ESM evaluation order — a stable-looking arrangement that a
// reordered import could silently redraw every highlight on every site. A separate seed
// cannot do that: nothing here can move a single stroke over there.

/**
 * One run of hand-drawn dashes in a 240x16 box, meant to be tiled.
 *
 * THE RANGES ARE WIDE ON PURPOSE, and they were CHOSEN BY LOOKING: four candidate runs were
 * grown and printed at eight times reading size, and the tidy ones lost. A set where every
 * dash is about the same length and sits on the same line reads as a machine's dashed rule
 * no matter how much edge wobble it carries; what makes a run look like a hand is that one
 * stroke runs long, the next is a stub, and they do not agree on where the line is. So the
 * length spans 9 to 30 units against gaps of 11 to 32, each dash drifts up to 1.6 units off
 * the run and leans up to 1.5 on its own, and the whole run tilts as well.
 *
 * The drift is the one number that was pulled BACK from what looked best in isolation:
 * under actual words, a line that wanders too far stops reading as a hand and starts
 * reading as a misaligned rule.
