// The highlighter pen itself: five measured pigments, and the shape of one stroke.
//
// This file exists because the pen was written down THREE times and had already drifted.
// `pen/ink.css.ts` drew it for the reader, `render/og-card.ts` drew it on the share card and
// `admin/components/editor-menus.ts` paints the five swatches in the bubble bar — each with its
// own copy of `d5f856`, and two of them with their own copy of the path. The card's second
// path was four numbers different from the page's, so the stroke under a shared headline was
// not the stroke under a highlighted sentence, and nothing anywhere said so. The card's
// comment claimed a test pinned the two together; there was no such test.
//
// So the pen is data now, in one import-free module, and the three readers ask for it. Same
// arrangement `pen/grammar.ts` and `render/math.ts` already use for their grammars, and for
// the same reason: a fact restated in three places is a fact that will disagree with itself.
//
// THE PIGMENTS ARE HARDCODED HEX, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to "public UI colours
// come only from theme tokens" (CLAUDE.md). A highlighter is not UI. It is a physical object
// dragged across the paper, and its pigment is the same fluorescent yellow whether the page
// around it is mono, sepia, ocean or forest. ADR 0018 records the trade and holds the
// numbers: they are MEASURED off a photograph of a real pen box, not chosen.

/**
 * DARK: the same five pens seen under a reading lamp, pre-mixed into the page.
 *
 * Two separate faults were fixed here and both are easy to reintroduce.
 *
 * 1. NOT `opacity` on the mark, and not `multiply`. Multiply on a near-black page turns every
 *    ink to mud; opacity fades the TEXT along with the ink, so the highlighted words came out
 *    DIMMER than the words around them — the one thing a highlight must never do. The alpha
 *    therefore lives in the pigment, which is why dark mode carries its own five values.
 * 2. The first mix (55%) put body text on the densest part of the stroke at 3.74:1 yellow,
 *    4.10:1 green, 4.49:1 orange — under the 4.5:1 this repo has already audited itself
 *    against. 45% is the brightest mix at which all five clear 5.0:1. Measured across the
 *    whole stroke, not at one point: the two paths overlap at ~91% alpha and the thinnest
 *    part is ~80%, so each ink spans a range and the WORST end of it is what was checked.
 *
 * Yellow is deliberately not the same hue as its light twin. The real pen is chartreuse
 * (hue 73) and light mode keeps that, but at dark-mode luminance chartreuse and the green
 * (hue 98) are 25° apart and both read as the same olive. Dark yellow is warmed to hue 50,
 * which opens the gap to 48° and still measures 5.07:1.
