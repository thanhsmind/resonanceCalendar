// One chosen colour becomes the four the pen needs — and an install that chose nothing gets
// the measured inks, unchanged, under the same hash it had yesterday.

// Added 2026-08-24 with `InkSettings`. The shape of that setting is the whole trick: every
// field is an OVERRIDE and '' means the built-in, so the values ADR 0018 measured stay in
// the code where they can still be corrected, rather than being copied into every install's
// database on first save.

/**
 * The pen's colours, and the selection highlight. EVERY FIELD IS AN OVERRIDE, and '' means
 * "the built-in", which is why the defaults are all empty strings.
 *
 * That shape is the whole design. ADR 0018 measured the five highlighter pigments off a
 * photograph of a real pen box and hand-tuned each one twice more (a dark-page mix audited
 * at 5.0:1, and a ballpoint-strength line version, because a pale sweep is invisible as a
 * 2px underline). Storing a full colour here would mean shipping a copy of those values into
 * every install's database, where they could never be corrected again. An override left
 * empty keeps the measured ink; an override that is set derives its own dark and line
 * variants (`pen/derive.ts`) from the one colour somebody chose.
 *
 * Owner's call, 2026-08-24, amending ADR 0018's "the colours are NOT a setting": the
 * argument there is that a highlighter should not restyle itself per PALETTE, and that still
 * holds — one pen for the whole site, whatever the reader picks. Which pen it is, is his.
