// The pen's grammar: `==text==` highlights, `++text++` underlines, `@@word@@` rings, each
// with an optional `#colour` suffix naming one of the five inks — and the hash that deals a
// stroke its variant.
//
// IMPORT-FREE ON PURPOSE (one constant from `dies.ts` aside). Four parsers read this grammar:
// the engine's inline parser (`md/inline-pen.ts`), the editor's typing
// rules (`admin/editor/input-rules.ts`) and `toPlainText` for excerpts. Each is
// built from the one regex SOURCE exported here rather than restating it — the two that were
// once written out separately drifted within the hour, and `toPlainText` put the word "green"
// into every excerpt of a post that used a colour suffix.
//
// The markup is deliberately the ONLY thing the parsers decide. What the stroke looks like is
// CSS (`pen/ink.css.ts`), because rendered bodies are cached under a hash of their Markdown:
// a stroke baked into the HTML could not be restyled without evicting every cached body.

 * It is carried anyway because four inks leave no cool colour at all, and a highlight that

 *  - The opening `==` must be followed by a character that is neither whitespace nor `=`, and
 *    the content must END on one. Without that, `a == b and c == d` highlights " b and c " —
 *    arithmetic and shell snippets in running text are common enough that this is the
 *    difference between a feature and a trap. Same rule GFM uses for `~~strikethrough~~`.
 *  - `(?!=)` on the close, so a run of three or more `=` is not a highlight.
 *
 * `[\s\S]` deliberately includes a newline: a highlighted sentence wrapped across two source
 * lines is one stroke. It cannot cross a BLANK line, because that ends the paragraph and this
 * tokenizer only sees one block's inline content. A run of `=` on its own line — a setext H1
 * underline — never reaches here; the block tokenizer has already claimed it.

 *                 inks. `<u>` on purpose: it is HTML's "unarticulated annotation", and a
 *                 feed reader that knows no CSS still shows an underline.
 *   `@@text@@`  — a ring around a word, drawn in red ballpoint unless a `#colour` says
 *                 otherwise. `<mark data-form="o">`: ringing a word IS marking it, and the
 *                 same feed reader degrades it to a visible mark.
 *
 * The opening pair may not touch whitespace and a triple is not a gesture, exactly as with
 * `==` — which keeps `C++ and ++i`, `x @@ y` and email-adjacent `@` runs out of the pen's
 * reach. Unlike the highlighter, a NAMED default is still an attribute here: `#yellow` on
 * an underline is a choice (the default is graphite), so it is never elided.
