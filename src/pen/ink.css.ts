// The highlighter pen's ink. `pen/grammar.ts` decides WHAT is highlighted (and stamps each
// highlight's `data-pen` identity); this decides what the stroke looks like, and the two are
// separate on purpose: rendered bodies are cached under a hash of their Markdown, so a
// stroke baked into the HTML could not be restyled without evicting every body on the site.
//
// THE PIGMENTS ARE HARDCODED HEX, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to "public UI colours
// come only from theme tokens" (CLAUDE.md). A highlighter is not UI. It is a physical object
// that was dragged across the paper, and its pigment is the same fluorescent yellow whether
// the page around it is mono, sepia, ocean or forest — a highlight that restyled itself per
// palette would read as a coloured box, which is the one thing it must not look like. ADR
// 0018 records the trade. The five values are MEASURED off a photograph of a real pen box,
// not chosen: `docs/decisions/0018-highlighter-pen.md` has the numbers.
//
// ONE STROKE STYLE, MANY HANDS. There used to be a three-way site setting here (marker /
// swipe / double) driving `--ink-h0`-family variables from `layout.ts`. It went when the
// pen learned to vary ITSELF: `pen/dies.ts` grows the dies and the forty grips, each
// highlight is dealt one by the `data-pen` hash of its own text, and a picker choosing
// between three uniformities had nothing left to offer.

// The pen's pigments and its stroke are DATA, and they live in `pen/pigments.ts`. They were
// written out here, again on the share card and a third time in the editor's swatches, and
// the card's copy of the path had already drifted four numbers from this one.
