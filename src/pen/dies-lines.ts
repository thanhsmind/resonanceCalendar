// The pen's line gestures: the underline and the ring. Grown from a seed of their own.
//
// The reference is a stack of photographs of a law student's textbook: whole sentences
// underlined in pen under the highlighter, and single words ("cease") ringed in ballpoint.
// What makes those read as a hand is not roughness. The first underline dies here had
// plenty of that — gaps, fades, a wander — and were reviewed as sloppy rather than
// handwritten, and as a pen running out of ink. A person underlining a line they care about
// draws one confident stroke: steady ink from end to end, a little heavier where the hand
// pressed, a little thinner where it eased, a slight bow from the wrist. VARIETY IN THE
// SHAPE, NEVER IN THE DENSITY: only the highlighter, whose felt genuinely runs dry, is
// allowed to fade, and this file has no fade in it.

 * The ring — in THREE pieces, because a stretched loop is not a hand-drawn loop.
 *
 * The first two ring builds drew one closed shape and stretched it to the word, and
 * around a long word the end curves stretched flat and the loop read as a capsule pill. A
 * person circles a word the other way round: the two END CURVES keep their round,
 * hand-sized curvature no matter how long the word is, and the stretch all happens in the
 * near-straight run over and under the letters. So the die is a left cap, a middle, and a
 * right cap; the caps ride at a FIXED em width (`ink.css.ts` sizes them; only the middle
 * stretches).
 *
 * Three things the third build changed, all from looking at the second next to the
 * photographs. The loop is an OVAL, not a stadium: the middle's two lines bow outward,
 * and the caps' arcs meet them at the seam. The pen CROSSES ITS OWN START: one cap
 * carries the tail, a curved ribbon that comes from inside the loop, runs over the arc
 * and out past it. And the pressure varies: the ribbon is heaviest on the far side of
 * each cap, where the hand swung round, and the tail is a lighter, faster stroke.
