// The pen: one module, one door.
//
// Everything a reader sees drawn by hand on a page comes from this directory — the
// highlighter (`==text==`), the underline (`++text++`), the ring (`@@word@@`) and the dashes
// under a link — and the directory is self-contained ON PURPOSE. Nothing in it imports from
// the rest of the application (`boundary.test.ts` holds the line); the application reaches
// in through this file. That is what makes the pen liftable: the WordPress theme, the
// marketing site and an embeddable `pen.css` can each take the whole hand without taking the
// blog around it.
//
// The layers, bottom up:
//
//   grammar.ts   the three fences as one regex each, and the hash that deals a stroke its
//                variant. Import-free, so four parsers can be built from it without drift.
//   (the parser)  NOT here any more. `marked.ts` held the server's inline extensions and came
//                out on 2026-09-13 with `marked` itself: `md/inline-pen.ts` reads the three
//                fences now, once, for the page and the editor and the excerpt together. The
//                editor's own marks (`admin/editor/schema-marks.ts`) are what DRAWS a stroke
//                while it is being written; they no longer parse one.
//   dies.ts      the hand: every stroke shape, grown from one seed. `dies-link.ts` grows the
//                link's dashes from a seed of its own.
//   pigments.ts  the five measured inks and the pencil and ballpoint, and the data-URI that
//                stamps a die in a colour.
//   derive.ts    one chosen colour becoming the four the pen needs.
//   palette.ts   the owner's overrides resolved against the built-ins, and the signature
//                that says whether anything was chosen at all.
//   ink.css.ts   the two sheets and the link rule, in whichever inks a site writes with.
//   lists.css.ts the marks at the head of a list item — dots, dashes, numerals — and the
//                off path that gives the browser's back (`dies-lists.ts` grows them).
//
// The contract with the page is three elements and two sheets: `<mark data-pen>` (with
// `data-ink` for a colour and `data-form="o"` for a ring), `<u data-pen>`, and the CSS that
// paints them. Cached bodies carry only the markup, so the hand can change without a single
// body re-rendering (ADR 0018, 0025, 0026).
