// THE ADMIN'S TAB STRIPS, as class strings both faces can read.
//
// Moved out of `admin/components/tabs.tsx` when the trash screen became a page (ADR 0054):
// the server renders that screen's kind strip now, and `src/admin` is excluded from the root
// TypeScript project so a server module cannot reach into it. A React `Tabs` component used to
// wrap these strings and re-export them; it left with React in ADR 0054's step 6.
//
// EVERYTHING IN THIS DIRECTORY IS FRAMEWORK-FREE: no React, no hono, no DOM. See the head of
// `kit.ts` for why that is the whole reason the directory exists.
//
// The rest of the original file's argument — why `lg` and `sm` are two different objects, and
// why a `place` is not a `choice` — travels with the strings it is about, below.

export type TabSize = 'lg' | 'sm'

// The tracks and the item are exported separately because Analytics' range control is made of
// LINKS: the range lives in the URL, so it cannot be a `<Tabs>` with an `onChange`. It had its
// own copy of the markup, one padding step off and with a different hover, which is how one
// control came to look like two. A link-driven strip wears these and gets the real thing.

// The underlined strip at the write pane's width: a 288px column cannot hold four words
// 24px apart, so the gap closes to 16 and the type steps down to the pane's own 13px.
// It does NOT wrap — four short words in every language, measured — because a strip that
// folds puts one word on a line of its own, which is what the segmented row used to do.
export const TAB_TRACK_DENSE = 'flex w-full items-end gap-4 border-b border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800'
// `overflow-x-auto`, not `overflow-hidden`, and the difference is the whole control on a
// phone. A hidden box IS a scroll container — script and focus can move it — but the browser
// gives the user no way to: a finger cannot pan it. So a segmented strip wider than its box
// did not merely look cut off, its far end was UNREACHABLE by touch. Measured 2026-08-28 on
// the Settings tabs: at 390px five of the eight tabs were past the edge, AI and System among
// them, and the only way to reach them was a `?tab=` URL. `no-scrollbar` keeps the bar
// itself out of a 32px-tall control; the strip still clips visually at its rounded edge.
// The track is carved — it CONTAINS the keys, so it wears the groove (`bg` one step off the
// card plus a 1px inner shadow); the active key is HELD DOWN in it. Ink-on-ink shading is
// invisible, so the pressed key also catches light on its lower inside edge.
// `min-h-8` — 32px, the small control height, and the height of the whole segmented family.
// The strip sets the height of the sheet's tools row: it is the widest thing on that row and
// the first thing read on it, so the save key and the search field beside it are sized to IT
// rather than the other way round. A MINIMUM rather than a fixed height, because three call
// sites let the strip wrap and a fixed one would halve their rows; a single-line strip lands
// on 32 exactly, its items stretching to 30 inside the 1px edge.
// ⚠️ TWO TRACKS, AND THE ROLE PICKS ONE. A groove is a CHOOSER's furniture: a value control
// that needs its chosen key to sit visibly lower than its neighbours. A `place` strip is
// NAVIGATION — the settings tabs, the trash's kinds — and it is the page's own first row;
// dressing it as a heavy grey control makes the top of every settings screen read as a
// widget rather than as a set of sections. Both were the same string for a few hours on
// 2026-09-07 and the settings tabs came out looking like a machine part.
//
// THE GROOVE, `neutral-200`, for a chooser. It was `neutral-50` — one point off the card it
// sits on, so the strip had no edges of its own and the chosen key had to be drawn DARKER
// than its own track to be seen. That inverts the object: a pressed key is not darker than
// the panel it is set into, it is the panel's face pushed down. With a real groove the key
// can be white and carved, which is what a segmented control on a desk looks like.

/**
 * What an active item MEANS, which turns out to be two different things wearing one costume.
 *
 * A `place` is a tab you navigated to: Site, Layout, Reading. A `choice` is a value you set:
 * English, 3:2, framed. They had the identical black pill, and on the Settings screen that
 * put "Site" — the section you are IN — beside "English" — a field's current value — in the
 * same ink, the same size, the same shape, eight lines apart. Nothing said which of the two
 * was answering "where am I". That sameness is most of what reads as machine-made: a screen
 * where everything is the same rectangle has told you nothing by the time you have looked
 * at all of it.
 *
 * So the highlighter marks WHERE YOU ARE and nothing else. It is the meaning the ink already
 * has on paper — the line you ran a marker over to come back to — and it is the reason this
 * is not decoration: a second colour that means one thing is a signal, and a palette is not.
 * A value you picked is not a place, so it takes the sunken paper key.
 *
 * The seam is the `Tabs` component below, which is the only thing in the admin that renders
 * navigation; the ten call sites that build a chooser out of `tabItemClass` directly are all
 * choices, and get the default.

 * everywhere else it butts against the key beside it, where a curve would cut a notch out of a
 * straight run. Rounding all four corners of a middle key was the first cut and it read as a
 * pill floating in a groove rather than as one segment of a strip.
