// The brace counter, which is the only part of the Custom CSS box with an opinion.
//
// It lives in `@/admin-shared/css-brace` since that box became server-drawn (ADR 0054): the
// server counts it once for the first paint and the island recounts on every keystroke, and a
// second implementation of this is a second answer to "is the stylesheet broken".
//
// It exists because an unclosed brace is how a stylesheet does NOTHING — not partly, not
// visibly, nothing — and the box gave no sign of it: you saved, the page did not change, and
// nowhere on the screen said why. Everything else in that component is layout.
//
// The cases below are all the ones a naive `split('{').length - split('}').length` gets
// wrong, and it would get them wrong in the direction that matters: crying about a file that
// is fine, on the one screen where a false alarm teaches the owner to ignore the warning.
