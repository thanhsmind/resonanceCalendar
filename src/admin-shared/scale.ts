// The admin's two SCALES: every size it sets in type, every gap it sets in space.
//
// The kit is the SURFACES — what a card is, what a table is. This is the MEASUREMENTS they
// are built from, and the answer has to be the same everywhere or there is no scale.
//
// There was not one. Measured before this file existed: a page title at 1.65rem/600, a card
// title at 15px/600, a label at 14px/500, a hint at 12px/20px and a stat figure at
// 1.65rem/600 — five sizes with no ratio between any two, and the page title the SAME SIZE
// as the number in a stat tile. No largest thing and no smallest thing; five middling ones.
//
// So: a ratio of about 1.25, and each step used for exactly one kind of thing.
//
//   30px  FIGURE         a number that IS the content — a stat tile, nothing else
//   28px  TITLE          the page's own name, once per screen, in Literata
//   16px  SECTION        a card's title, settings cards included
//   14px  SETTING_LABEL  the label on one setting
//   13px  NOTE           the sentence explaining a setting
//   12px  META / UTIL    table heads, counts, timestamps · and the eyebrow over a group
//
// ⚠️ A SEVENTH STEP WAS REMOVED ON 2026-09-07. `GROUP_TITLE` set a settings card's title at
// 17px, bought on 2026-09-04 because 15/600 over 14/500 left the owner unable to pick a group
// title out of a column of thirty-seven. What that bought was one point of size for the outer
// box while the stretches INSIDE it stayed at 16/600 — so the extra point was being spent on
// the smaller of the two distances. The groups are now a 12px eyebrow (`UTIL`), which makes
// the distance four points and two weights and leaves nothing for a step of its own to do. A
// size worn by exactly one component is not a step in a scale; it is that component's opinion.
//
// ⚠️ THE PAGE TITLE WENT UP, 22px to 28px, on 2026-09-07 — reversing the 26.4→22 change
// that preceded it, and the measurement is the reason. At 22/500 over a card title at
// 15/600 the name of the SCREEN was seven pixels and one weight step from the name of a BOX
// on it, and the type histogram of the home page had exactly ONE run at 22px against 61 at
// 12px: the largest thing on the screen carried 0.8% of its text. The argument that a tool's
// page title is a location and not a headline still holds — what it does not follow from is
// that a location should be almost the same size as everything around it. It is now the one
// line of Literata this admin sets (`PAGE_TITLE_FACE`), which is what lets it be quiet and
// unmistakable at the same time.
//
// ⚠️ 11px IS GONE. Two runs of it were measured on the home page, both inside chord badges,
// which put the smallest type in the admin on a control nobody reads twice. `check:admin-kit`
// fails a file that hand-types it.
//
// One face, Inter, since 2026-08-15; the reading face is confined to the EDITOR, which is
// WYSIWYG. So ranking here is done entirely by SIZE and WEIGHT.
