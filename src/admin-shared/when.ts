// a page (ADR 0054). The React versions each read `document.documentElement.lang` for the
// locale, which a server module cannot do, so the language is a parameter now — and that is
// the better shape anyway: the admin knows its own language from settings and does not have to
// ask the DOM what it wrote there.
//
// `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` does the words, so eleven languages get their own plural rules
// without a table here, and "2 giờ trước" needs nobody to translate it.
//
// ⚠️ THREE BUCKETINGS, ON PURPOSE, and they are not interchangeable. A feed is read for
// recency and wants minutes; a publication date wants "today" and then days; a process uptime
// must never collapse four minutes and nineteen hours into the same word, because that is the
// difference between "it just came back" and "it has been fine all day".

 * shows the one that matches. The same trick the rail uses for the Mac chord, for the same
 * reason: a fact only the browser holds, decided before anything is drawn rather than after.

 * admin rendered as a blank page, on every screen.
