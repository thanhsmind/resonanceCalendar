// All three are pure: a country code in, a string out. Nothing here touches the DOM, reads a
// context or asks the browser for a locale, which is what let them cross to the server
// unchanged — the React versions were already written that way.
//
// The one that did NOT come across is `StatTile`: it was `StatCard` plus a trend arrow, and
// the server kit's `statCard` already takes an `after` slot. A second name for the same tile
// is how the two faces drifted by one shade of grey the last time.
