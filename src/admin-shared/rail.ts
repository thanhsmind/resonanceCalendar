// THE RAIL, DESCRIBED ONCE — every row the admin's left column can hold, and where rows go.
//
// It sits in `src/admin-shared/` because two faces wear it: The server renders the rail into HTML (`web/admin/rail.ts`) and the island runs it
// in the browser (`admin/island/rail.ts`), and a row that exists in one and not the other is a
// door that appears or disappears depending on which of them last drew it.
//
// NO FRAMEWORK, NO DOM, NO JSX. That is what makes it shareable at all: `src/admin` is
// excluded from the root TypeScript project precisely so a server module cannot reach for
// `document`, so anything both sides need has to live out here and touch neither. An icon is
// a NAME from `@/icons`, never a rendered element — the server wraps it in its own `<svg>`
// and the island wraps it in another, and both wrappers are already written.
//
// THREE SUBJECTS, in this order: what a row IS, where rows GO, and what a row WEARS. The
// third arrived from `admin/components/headerActions.ts` for the same reason as the other two
// — a class list drawn by one face and not the other is a rail that changes shape depending on
// who rendered it. What is NOT here is which rows a given install has stored, which is
// `content/nav-order.ts`, and it is not here because it is a SETTING rather than a fact about
// the product.

// screen, sitting in the rail on every single page. Now it is the mark the rest of the

// a wash of the pen diluted into the paper. Same ink, same meaning as an active TAB
// (`tabs.ts`) — the highlighter marks the place you are in, never the value you chose —
// but a run of a marker, not a slab of it.
//
// The row is a KEY, so the current page is a key HELD DOWN — in the SAME full pen the
// active tab wears, carved with the SAME inset. It was a 30% wash for one evening, and the
// owner read the two marks side by side as two different inks; where-you-are is one ink at
// one strength wherever it appears, held down.
//
// The INK on it flips with the theme, and only the ink. In light the pen is #d5f856 and the
// mark is written in near-black, as a highlighter over a page is. In dark the pen is #7e7028
// — a highlighter seen under low light, not a lime slab — and near-black on it measured
// 3.8:1, under the 4.5 a label has to clear, which is why it read as grey smeared on
// mustard. White on that same olive measures 5.0:1.

// under its label (`tabs.ts`): where-you-are is one shape in two orientations rather than two
