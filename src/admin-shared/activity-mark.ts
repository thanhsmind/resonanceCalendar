// The glyph and the ink an ACTIVITY FEED row wears.
//
// Moved out of `ActivityFeed.tsx` when the dashboard became a page (ADR 0054).
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS NOT `glyphOf`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS DELIBERATE ON BOTH SIDES. `log-sentence.ts`
// maps an action to one of seven KINDS and gives each kind a glyph, because on the Log screen
// the glyph and the kind filter beside it are the same seven things: a row's mark tells you
// which filter would keep it. Here the verb is checked FIRST, so `post.delete` is a bin rather
// than a page — what the eye wants from a feed is the shape of what happened, and "something
// was thrown away" is the shape worth finding fastest.
//
// The consequence is real and is left standing on purpose: one event can wear two glyphs on
// two screens. Unifying them would mean deciding which of the two arguments is wrong, and
// neither is, so that is a design question rather than a port.
