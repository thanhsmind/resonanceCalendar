 * role column, none in the schema. What kept there being one account was that only this
 * function creates them and only the CLI calls it — and the CLI refused a duplicate USERNAME
 * while being perfectly happy to make a second owner. An invariant held by nobody, at the
 * exact moment the hosted tier was being designed, which is when somebody adds a signup route.

 * account — one proves a session cannot be revoked from another, the other that a CSRF token
 * does not travel between them. Everywhere else the flag is ignored rather than honoured, so
 * no running instance can pass anything to get a second owner. A signup route could not be
 * written against this even deliberately: it would pass its own tests and refuse in
 * production, which is the failure direction to want.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a check on `id` and not a `role` column. Both introduce the concept ADR
 * 0002 spent its length rejecting — that there is more than one kind of account — to solve a
 * problem that is really about who may CREATE one.
