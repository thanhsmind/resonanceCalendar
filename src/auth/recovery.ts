// submitted code against every unused hash — up to ten ~100ms verifications, so about a
// second in the worst case. That is acceptable because redemption is rare and rate limited
// to 5/hour, and the alternative (a fast hash, justified by the codes being high-entropy
// and machine-generated) would make the stored form materially weaker than the password
// beside it for no user-visible gain.
