/**
 * Follow a post that changed its slug, so its send history follows it too.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR: `statsByPost` is keyed by slug and it is what tells the send
 * tab a post has already gone out, which is the only thing standing between a rename and
 * a second copy of the same newsletter in every subscriber's inbox. A newsletter cannot be
 * unsent, so this is the one rename that has to be atomic with the post's own.
 *
 * `post_slug` holds a COMMA-SEPARATED list, because a digest row credits every post it
 * carried. So the swap is done on the list and not on the column: both sides are wrapped
 * in commas first, which is what keeps `pen` from matching inside `open-letter`, and the
 * wrapping commas are trimmed back off afterwards. `instr` rather than `like` so a slug
 * never has to be escaped.
