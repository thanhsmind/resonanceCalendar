// Manual newsletter broadcast: email one or more chosen posts to the confirmed
// subscribers, triggered by the owner from Admin → Newsletter. There is no automatic
// send — a scheduled post goes live on time but never mails anyone by itself (owner's
// call: every send is previewed and pressed by hand).
//
// Several posts = ONE digest email (newest leads, the rest follow), not one email per
// post — picking three posts should not put three messages in someone's inbox.
//
// Every subscriber gets their OWN message: the unsubscribe link and the open pixel are
// per-recipient, so a single BCC blast would break both.
//
// Double-send guard: `posts.broadcast_at` is stamped on every send, and the caller must
// pass `force` to send a post that already has successful sends in the log. The LOG is
// the source of truth for "already sent", not the stamp — older posts carry a backfilled
// stamp from the retired auto-broadcast with no matching log rows.
// SERVER-ONLY.
