 * How long one sweep may spend encoding before it stops and leaves the rest for next time.
 *
 * A BUDGET IN TIME, not a count, and the reason is what it is defending against. `Bun.serve`
 * closes a request that has produced nothing for its `idleTimeout`, and the cron tick is the
 * one route in this product that can run for minutes: on the demo, eighteen pending
 * originals at about 1.4 s each. What the operator saw was `curl: (52) Empty reply from
 * server` and a tick that appeared to do nothing — while it had in fact finalised seven and
 * been cut off. A count would have to be tuned per box and per image size; a deadline tunes
 * itself, and the sweep is idempotent so whatever is left is simply next hour's work.
 *
 * `pruneRendered` bounds itself the same way, by batch, for the same reason.
