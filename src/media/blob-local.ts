// through a dynamic import() from `blob.ts` so node:fs never lands in a client bundle.
// SERVER-ONLY.
//
// Files are served back over HTTP by app/uploads/[...path]/route.ts under the
// `/uploads` prefix, which is the same prefix blob.ts uses to build public URLs.

// loads, and it silently broke a test: `bun test` shares one module registry across files, so
// a suite that set `STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR` and then imported this got whatever an earlier file
// had already frozen in — and wrote its fixtures into the repository's own uploads directory.
// A getenv per file operation is noise next to the I/O it precedes.

 * in front of it would refuse to route to it, before anyone had done anything wrong. CI
 * caught this on a clean checkout; every developer machine already had the directory from
 * the first time it ran.
