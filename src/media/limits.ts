// How large one upload may be, and how large the whole store may grow.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: neither number existed anywhere in the software. What actually refused an
// oversized image was `client_max_body_size` in nginx — 64M in the recommended vhost, 1m on
// the demo, whatever a self-hoster's proxy happens to be. That made the limit a property of
// ONE deployment's proxy rather than of the software, so anyone running behind a tunnel, a
// PaaS or nothing at all had no limit and nothing said so.
//
// TWO LAYERS, and the split is deliberate:
//
//   1. `blob-local.put()` refuses anything over the ENVIRONMENT's ceiling. It is the single
//      point every stored byte passes through — media, attachments, icons, fonts, the derived
//      variants, the MCP tool that rehosts from a URL — so a route that forgets to ask still
//      cannot write past it. It reads no settings, so it cannot cycle back through
//      `content/settings.ts`, which imports the storage facade itself.
//   2. The routes ask THIS module — the environment's ceiling narrowed by the owner's setting
//      — and answer 413. That makes the refusal a sentence the admin can show instead of a
//      500, and because `File.size` is known before the body is read, it also keeps a 900 MB
//      upload from becoming 900 MB of resident memory on the way to being rejected.
//
// ⚠️ THE CEILING ONLY EVER NARROWS. `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` and `STORAGE_QUOTA_GB` are the operator's;
// the admin fields can lower them and never raise them. An operator hosting for somebody else
// needs a number the blog cannot argue with.
