//
// Storage is the local filesystem: binaries live under STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR and are
// served at /uploads by app/uploads/[...path]/route.ts. The pure URL/rewrite helpers
// below stay filesystem-free (safe in a client bundle); the IO helpers dispatch to
// the local driver (blob-local.ts) via a dynamic import() so node:fs never reaches a
// client bundle. No src file may import a cloud storage SDK (check:no-direct-blob).

// so stored content carries no origin and renders after a host change (Invariant 3).
//
// The prefix only counts where a URL BEGINS: at the start of the string, or right after
// `](` / `src="` / `href="`, mirroring how expandWith() anchors. An unanchored global
// `/uploads/` also matches mid-path in somebody else's URL, and every WordPress site
// serves its images from `/wp-content/uploads/…` — collapsing that silently rewrote
// imported posts to point at `…/wp-contentphoto.jpg`, an image that does not exist.

  // browser against the post's own address, pointing at a file that is not there. Every
  // download link an owner wrote into a post was broken, on every install, and nothing said so
