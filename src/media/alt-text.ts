// The AI describer: writes alt text for an uploaded image, in the site's own language.
//
// Pasting a key in Admin → Settings → AI is the master switch, and "Describe uploaded
// images" beside it is this job's own; both must be on for a single byte to leave the
// machine. The provider plumbing lives in `server/ai-provider.ts` — this file knows only
// the image job: which files qualify, what to ask, and the one rule about the answer:
//
//   `alt IS NULL` guards the write. NULL means "never described"; '' means the owner
//   CLEARED it, and refilling a cleared field would be the machine overruling a person.
