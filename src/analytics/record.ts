// Privacy-light, self-hosted page-view recording.
//
// WHY this design:
// - No cookies, no localStorage, no third party. A visitor is identified only by a salted
//   hash of (IP + user-agent), so NO raw IP / PII is ever stored — just an opaque token
//   used to count uniques. The salt never leaves the server, so the token is stable enough
//   for accurate unique counts and useless outside this instance.
// - One row per view, plus two privacy-light source fields: the external referrer HOST
//   only (never the full URL/path/query; NULL for direct/internal) and the ISO country
//   code from the edge. No IP, no fingerprint.
// - Bots are dropped by user-agent. Admin/API paths are never tracked, and the owner's own
//   visits are excluded by the route.
// - Retention: events are kept FOREVER (no purge) — the owner wants the full history.
// - Scroll depth: a separate `analytics_scroll` table holds one "% of page reached before
//   leaving" sample per visit (a reader on a page, within half an hour — a later leave
//   updates it, see buffer.ts), so a missed pagehide loses a depth sample but never a view.
//
// Writes go through the buffer (Invariant 7), never straight to the database. The frozen
// tree inserted inline and carried a retry for a pre-migration schema; there is one schema
// here, so that fallback is gone.

 * Is this a path the site can actually serve? The beacon is an open POST — the shape cap

 * could seed `analytics_events` with fabricated paths: junk in the top-pages table,
 * unbounded distinct-path growth, all rate-limited per IP and therefore not bounded at
 * all. The route list here mirrors `web/app.ts`; a single-segment path must be a real
 * post, page, or the list's own address. One indexed point-lookup per view, on the
 * buffered (never request-blocking) side — see Invariant 7.
 *
 * An archive-shaped path is resolved the way the router resolves it, through the same
 * `resolveTerm` and `resolveSeries` over the public posts, and a list page has to be one
 * the list has. Until 2026-09-10 the shape was enough, so `/page/999` and
 * `/tag/nonexistent` — a crawler's guess, a link that had rotted — counted as views of a
 * page that answers 404. This costs one read of the post index, and only on the archive
 * shapes: a post view still pays the one point-lookup.
