// Snapshots, kept on this machine.
//
// One snapshot is a `tar.gz` holding both databases and the uploads tree — the same
// archive the owner can download from Settings, written to a directory on the box instead
// of streamed to a browser. The schedule and the retention count in Settings drive it, and
// until now drove nothing: 2.0 dropped Google Drive (parity exception 1) and the fields
// stayed behind pointing at a destination that no longer existed.
//
// A copy that lives beside the thing it is copying survives a bad delete, a bad restore
// and a bad migration, and does not survive the disk — so every archive written here is
// also SHIPPED, when a bucket is configured: `backup-offsite.ts` (ADR 0035) PUTs it into
// any S3-compatible store and prunes the remote copies to the same retention. The ops
// script in `scripts/ops/quire-backup.sh` remains for fleets that would rather run their
// own; `docs/backups.md` holds the map.
//
// The databases are copied through SQLite's own `VACUUM INTO` rather than read off disk: a
// live database has a write-ahead log, and copying the file alone can capture a torn state
// that only reveals itself on restore.

 * 530.3 MB. Everything a reader has ever written — 90 posts, their revisions, every setting —

 *
 * That is not merely wasteful. The archive is the thing somebody downloads on their worst
 * day, and 263 MB through a CDN with a request timeout is a download that can fail where a
 * 30 MB one cannot. A backup nobody can take away is not a backup — which is how this was
 * found: the owner tried, on the day the cache had grown past what the button could carry.
 *
 * The cache is a pure function of the Markdown beside it, keyed by a hash of that Markdown.
 * Restoring without it costs the first reader of each post one render, once.

 * Emptied on the COPY, never on the live database: `VACUUM INTO` has already taken a
