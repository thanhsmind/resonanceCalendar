// The in-admin assistant: the second door onto the one tool registry.
//
// Somebody with a Claude subscription connects over MCP and never needs this. Somebody
// who plugged an API key into Settings → AI gets the same steward INSIDE the admin: a
// chat box whose every ability is a tool from `mcp/registry.ts`, executed here on the
// server, under the owner's session, logged like every other action. One list, two
// doors, one rulebook — the assistant cannot do anything MCP cannot, by construction.
//
// The loop is deliberately small: up to MAX_ROUNDS tool rounds per message, arguments
// validated against each tool's own zod schema before the handler runs (a model's JSON
// is a guess, not a contract), results truncated before they ride back. This is the
// pocket assistant, and the docs say so: short memory, no web, as clever as the model
// the owner chose.
