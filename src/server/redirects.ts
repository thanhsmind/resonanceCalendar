 * **Fail-open.** A redirect table that cannot be read must not be able to take the site
 * down with it, so an error is logged and the request carries on to the router.
 *
 * The frozen tree cached this for 60 seconds (`v1/src/middleware.ts`). That cache was
 * paid for by its lookup being an HTTP fetch to PostgREST; here it would buy nothing but
 * a minute in which a redirect the owner just saved does not work.
