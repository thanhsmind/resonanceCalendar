// Invariant 1, in its 2.0 form.

// The frozen tree spread invalidation across Next's ISR page cache, a tagged Data Cache
// and `lib/revalidate.ts`, which computed a per-write superset of affected paths and was
// pinned by a test because it was easy to under-purge. Here there is one Map and every
// write empties all of it. Re-rendering a post from SQLite costs well under a
// millisecond, so a total flush is not a performance question at this scale.
//
// Do NOT reintroduce targeted invalidation. If a measurement ever shows the flush
// matters, the answer is a rollup table or a longer edge TTL, not a dependency graph.

/**
 * How much rendered HTML this process will hold, in characters of key plus body.
 *
 * `PAGE_CACHE_MB` (`env.ts`), read once. A character of an ASCII page is one byte in
 * JavaScriptCore and a page with non-latin text is two, so the environment variable names
 * the megabytes of an English blog's HTML and is an upper bound on any other.
 *
 * ⚠️ A BUDGET, NOT A PAGE COUNT, because pages are not the same size: a 2 KB note and an
 * 85,000-character essay are one entry each and two very different amounts of memory.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-21 in a container, which is the only place these numbers mean anything —
 * JavaScriptCore sizes its heap to the machine, so the same corpus reads 282 MB on a 48 GB
 * laptop and 117 MB under a 128 MB limit. A blog of 1,000 posts, `--memory=128m --cpus=0.25`:
 *
 *   unbounded, as it shipped   117.6 MB of 128, and OOM-KILLED on 2 of 3 restarts
 *   the same box, cache off     44.8 MB idle, 66.3 MB after reads
 *   8 MB budget                 90.0 MB, 315 pages warmed, no kill
 *
 * The warmer renders every public post at boot and after every write (`warm.ts`), so the
 * unbounded Map held 977 pages nobody had asked for. That is the whole difference, and on the
 * small box it was the difference between running and a restart loop.
 *
 * `--smol` was measured against this and is NOT the answer: 86.8 MB against 90.0, because
 * what the cache holds is retained rather than uncollected garbage.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE: a blog under the budget behaves exactly as it did. 100 posts of
 * this size come to 2.4 MB — the whole archive still fits, nothing is ever evicted, and the
 * only code that runs is one addition per store.

 * ceiling holds because every writer remembered to go through one function has no ceiling. The
 * two writers are `web/listing-page.ts` and `server/warm.ts`; a third one day should not have
 * to know this file exists.
 *
 * EVICTION IS LEAST-RECENTLY-READ, and that part is not decoration either. Insertion order
 * alone would let a crawler walking a 900-post archive push the front page out, which is the
 * one page that is certain to be asked for again. A `Map` keeps insertion order and a
 * delete-then-set moves a key to the end, so a read costs one extra pair of operations and

   * Two wrong versions came before it, both of which read perfectly:
   *
   *   `#chars >= budgetChars()` as a "full" test — `set` always evicts back to at or under the
   *   budget, so the count is essentially never over it, the warm never stops, and all 977
   *   pages render exactly as before. Every measurement in this file would still be true of it.
   *
   *   `set` for the whole warm, stopping once something had been evicted — the warm renders in
   *   PRIORITY order, `/` first, so the first thing an over-budget archive threw away was the
   *   home page. The one page certain to be asked for again, evicted by the warm meant to have
   *   it ready. Caught by the test asserting `/` is still there, not by reading this.
   *
   * Both are why the offer exists: rendered pages go in in priority order and nothing already
   * paid for is thrown away to make room for something further down the list. A reader's own
   * request still uses `set`, where evicting IS the right answer — that page was asked for.
   *
   * A single body larger than the whole budget is refused rather than stored, and ends the
   * warm there. It is 8 million characters; the largest post this project has measured is
   * 85,000. A reader who asks for it still gets it cached, through `set`.
