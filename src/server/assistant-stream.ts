// THREE SHAPES. The OpenAI family sends `choices[].delta`; Anthropic sends named events
// and builds each content block by index, a tool call's arguments arriving as
// `partial_json`; Gemini sends whole `candidates[].content.parts` and needs `?alt=sse` or
// it answers with a JSON array instead of a stream. All three fold into the one ChatAnswer
// the rest of the loop already knows, and all three were verified against a live key —
// which is the only kind of verification this layer accepts, after a week in which DeepSeek
// passed 2488 tests and was still broken in four places only a real call could show.
//
// PURE except for the reader at the bottom: the folding is a function of (state, chunk),
// so every shape below is tested against recorded payloads rather than a live provider.
