// The one request this software makes on its own behalf, and everything it does not say.
// The decision and its alternatives are ADR 0036.
//
// A blog asks what the newest release is, and by asking it is counted — one call doing two
// jobs, so there is no telemetry service to keep alive. What leaves the process:
//
//     GET https://check.quireink.com/releases.json?v=2.2.2&t=8f2c91a04b7e&d=1&new=1&a=3&p=2&i=docker&l=vi
//
//   v    the version this instance runs
//   t    sha256(this instance's own secret + today's UTC date), first 12 hex characters
//   d    1 when the site has a real public address, 0 when it is still on a laptop
//   new  present only on the first check a fresh database ever makes
//   a    how old the blog is, in five steps (absent while nobody has claimed it)
//   p    how much is published, in four steps
//   i    `docker`, `source`, or what an install template declared for itself
//   l    the language this owner's admin is in
//
// ⚠️ THE LAST FOUR ARE STEPS, NOT VALUES, and that is the whole of why they may exist. `t`
// guarantees today cannot be tied to yesterday; a field precise enough to be a fingerprint
// would hand that back — with a dozen blogs checking in on one day, an exact post count beside
// a country names an install as surely as its domain would.
//
// No address, no hostname, no title, no content, no exact count, no identifier that survives
// the day. Counting by IP was the alternative and it breaks on the shape this product is
// licensed for: one process per blog (ADR 0021) means a hundred blogs can share one address.
//
// `docs/update-check.md` says all of this again for somebody deciding whether to allow it, and
// Settings says it in eleven languages to the owner who holds the switch. Three copies, and
// they move together or not at all.

/**
 * Why this deployment is not reporting, or null when it is.
 *
 * ⚠️ INVERTED on 2026-08-22. The rule was "report only when
 * `NODE_ENV=production`". The Docker image sets that; the systemd unit in `docs/self-host.md`
 * never did — so every from-source install would have been silent FOREVER while looking
 * healthy, and the number would have counted Docker and nothing else, silently.
 *
 * So the question is now the honest one: is this clearly NOT a real install? Each answer was
 * measured on Bun 1.3.14, because the whole trap was an assumption about what sets `NODE_ENV`:
 *
 *   bun src/index.ts           NODE_ENV unset       execArgv []           <- systemd: REPORTS
 *   bun --watch src/index.ts   NODE_ENV unset       execArgv ['--watch']  <- `bun run dev`: silent
 *   bun test                   NODE_ENV 'test'      execArgv []           <- silent
 *   the Docker image           NODE_ENV 'production'                      <- REPORTS
 *
 * `--watch` separates the two cases that share an empty `NODE_ENV`, and it is the flag
 * `bun run dev` is defined with. A second net makes loosening the first safe: a developer's
 * machine has no public `SITE_URL`, so anything slipping through arrives as `d=0` and lands on
 * the TRIAL line, kept out of "blogs alive" because a trial is deleted and recreated all week.
 *
 * Memoised: none of these can change under a running process.
 *
 * TWO KINDS of answer, named separately, because a screen that gives the wrong one is worse
 * than one that gives none — the admin printed `UPDATE_CHECK=0` on an instance that had never
 * set the variable, when the real cause was a missing `NODE_ENV`.
