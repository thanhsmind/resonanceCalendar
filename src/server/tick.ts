// is two descriptions of one job, and they drift within a release. The route is now a
// bearer check, a rate limit and one call.

 * The frequent tick: flip due scheduled posts live, and read a few link cards.
 *
 * Its lookback matches its cadence. One indexed query when there is nothing due, which is
 * why it can afford to run every minute on a clock the operator did not have to configure.
 *
 * The link sweep and the fediverse sweep are both here rather than on the hour, and for one
 * reason each: a card that took an hour would read as broken, and a post that took an hour
 * to reach a follower would read as a blog nobody maintains.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LINK SWEEP IS HERE AND NOT ON THE HOUR because of what it is for: an owner publishes
 * a post with a link in it and looks at the page. An hour is long enough that the card would
 * read as broken rather than as coming. It keeps the tick's character — its "anything to do?"
 * is one lookup in a PARTIAL index holding only rows nobody has read yet, so on a blog with
 * nothing waiting it is empty and the query costs what the one above costs.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT in `FullTick`'s report. A count of pages read is not a maintenance
 * figure the owner is being shown, and the hourly summary is that report.
