// the loop in `assistant.ts` owns everything stateful.
//
// The neutral shape is four kinds of turn. Each dialect folds them differently —
// Anthropic wants tool results inside a user message, OpenAI wants them as their own
// `tool` role, Gemini wants a `functionResponse` part and has no call ids at all — and
// the whole point of this file is that nothing outside it ever learns those facts.

// A name added to OPENAI_COMPATIBLE is added to every AI job at once, because
// `ai-provider.ts` reads the same table for alt text, excerpts and the comment guard.
// That is the point: one list, or a provider that works in the chat box and silently
// does nothing everywhere else.

// a fourth was about to (ADR 0054's island). Re-exported so every import here still resolves.
//
// `reasoning` is what the model thought on its way to a set of calls. Only some providers hand
// it out, and DeepSeek REFUSES the next round without it back (`echoesReasoning`), so it rides
// on the turn rather than being dropped at the door. `at` is when the call was DISPATCHED,
