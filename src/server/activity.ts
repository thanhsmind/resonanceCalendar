 * sign-in — written whatever the owner's toggle says, on purpose, because a security trail a

 * could grow this blog's database and every snapshot of it, one slow guess at a time.
 *
 * The age is what the log is FOR: what did I change, and when. A year answers that.
 *
 * The ceiling is the part that had to be thought about, because a plain oldest-first trim
 * hands the flood the ability to push out the very entries an owner would go looking for. So
 * the refused sign-ins are trimmed first and on their own: past a few thousand they say the
 * same thing the first hundred did, while a save or a settings change never repeats.
