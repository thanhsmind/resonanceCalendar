// The tree every part of this blog reads the same document from.
//
// FOUR ENGINES READ MARKDOWN HERE before this one existed, and none of them knew about the
// others: `marked` for the reader's page, `markdown-it` for opening a post in the editor,
// `prosemirror-markdown` for saving it again, and a run of regular expressions in
// `toPlainText` for the excerpt, the meta description, the OG card and the RSS summary. Every
// one of them had to be taught this blog's own notation — the pen's `==ink==#green`,
// `++underline++` and `@@ring@@`, the maths, the footnotes, the callouts — and 2,075 lines
// existed to do the teaching. They drifted, which is what four answers to one question do:
// the word "green" once reached every excerpt on the site, and 19 of 45 golden fixtures
// published differently after a single pass through the editor.
//
// This file is the fix stated as a shape. ONE syntax tree, produced once, rendered into
// whatever a caller needs — HTML for the reader, a ProseMirror document for the writer,
// Markdown on the way back, plain text for the deck. A question asked of the notation is
// answered in the parser, and every output agrees by construction rather than by three
// people keeping three parsers in step.
//
// The node set is CommonMark's, plus GFM's four, plus this blog's own. It is deliberately
// FLAT — a discriminated union with a `type` string rather than a class hierarchy — because
// the renderers are switch statements and a switch over a union is exhaustively checked by
// the compiler. Adding a node type makes every renderer fail to compile until it says what
// it does with it, which is the property that keeps the outputs in step.

 * showed this and the engine on its own did — the importer being the one path that meets it.
