// What a HOST asks of the renderer, as against what the spec asks.
//
// `html.ts` answers to CommonMark and GFM: every rule in it is one a spec example measures,
// and it may not hold an opinion the spec does not. This file holds the SLOTS for the
// opinions — six things no Markdown spec mentions, five of them carried until 2026-09-13 as
// a `marked` option or a renderer override in `render/post-content.ts`, and every one of
// them a rule a different host would reasonably set differently.
//
// Keeping them here rather than in the renderer is what makes the engine portable: the
// default below is the spec and nothing else, so a second site — or this engine published on
// its own — starts from CommonMark and adds what it wants. What THIS blog wants is
// `render/page-rules.ts`, on the other side of the line, because two of its answers are
// things the engine must not own — a slug function that knows Vietnamese and Cyrillic, and
// a LaTeX engine.
//
// ⚠️ ONE OF THEM IS A SECURITY CONTROL, not a preference. `safeLinks` is what stops
// `[js](javascript:alert(1))` from publishing as a working link, and the engine had the hole
// open until the golden suite printed it beside the page v1 produces:
//
//     v1      <a href="#">js</a>
//     engine  <a href="javascript:alert(1)">js</a>
//
// It was found by wiring the engine up as a MEASUREMENT rather than as a switch, which is the
// only reason it turned up on the bench instead of on the site.
