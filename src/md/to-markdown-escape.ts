// WHAT ONE PIECE OF TEXT MAY BE WRITTEN AS.

// Split out of `to-markdown.ts` on 2026-09-21, when a fix to its line-start rules put that file
// over the 400-line ceiling. The seam is the one that file's own header already names:
// "Escaping is the other half." Everything left there decides STRUCTURE — which block follows
// which, how a list indents, where a table's pipes go. Everything here decides what a run of
// characters has to become so that reading it back produces the same characters.
//
// The two are read at different moments. Somebody chasing a paragraph that split in half comes
// here; somebody chasing a list that lost its nesting does not.

 *
 * ⚠️ IT ASKS THE GRAMMAR RATHER THAN RESTATING IT, which is the rule `pen/grammar.ts` states
 * about itself and the one this function got wrong twice. A first version escaped every `==`,
 * so `x == y and z == w` came back as `x \== y and z \== w` — an author opening their own post
 * to find backslashes they never typed. A second version escaped a pair followed by a
 * non-space, which is the OPENING guard, and that escaped `++i` in `C++ và ++i` where no
 * closing pair exists anywhere and no stroke could ever form.
 *
 * A pair is only dangerous when the whole shape is there. Running the three real patterns says
 * so exactly, and it stays true the day the grammar changes: over-escaping corrupts what the
 * writer sees, under-escaping corrupts what the next read produces, and only the grammar knows
 * where the line is.
