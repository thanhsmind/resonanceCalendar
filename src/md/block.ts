// Phase one: the document's block structure, one line at a time.
//
// The algorithm is CommonMark's own and the shape is worth stating once, because every
// tempting simplification of it is wrong. A line is not matched against a list of patterns.
// It is walked DOWN the stack of blocks that are currently open — document, then blockquote,
// then list item, then the paragraph inside it — and each one is asked whether this line
// still belongs to it. Only when that walk stops does the line get to open something new.
//
// That order is what makes `> - foo` one line opening three blocks, and what makes a line
// four spaces in mean code in one place and a paragraph in another. A parser that pattern-
// matches lines gets the easy 80% and then cannot be repaired.
//
// The one exception is LAZY CONTINUATION: a paragraph inside a blockquote continues even
// when the line carries no `>`, because that is how people actually write them. It is the
// reason `continues()` returning "no" is not the end of the story.
