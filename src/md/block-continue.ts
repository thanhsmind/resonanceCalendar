// Whether an open block still owns the line being read.
//
// One question, asked of every block on the stack from the document down, and the answers are
// what give Markdown its shape: a blockquote wants its `>`, an item wants its indent, a
// paragraph wants any non-blank line at all, and a fence wants everything until its match.
//
// Split out of the loop in `block.ts` at the 400-line ceiling, and the seam is a real one:
// nothing here touches the tree. It reads a block and a line, consumes the marker when there
// is one, and answers. The loop decides what to do about it.
