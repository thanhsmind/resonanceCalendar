// The delimiter stack, and the algorithm that turns runs of `*` and `_` into emphasis.
//
// THIS IS THE PART THAT CANNOT BE DONE IN ONE PASS. Reading `*foo bar*` left to right, the
// first `*` cannot be resolved when it is met — whether it opens anything depends on what
// turns up later, and `*foo` with no closer is just an asterisk. So the scan records every
// run of delimiters as it goes and the matching happens afterwards, walking the stack.
//
// The inlines are held as a DOUBLY LINKED LIST rather than an array for the same reason. The
// algorithm reaches back to a delimiter it passed, takes everything between it and the
// current position, and wraps it — an operation that is three pointer moves in a list and a
// pair of index-shifting splices in an array, with every delimiter's remembered position
// invalidated by each one.
//
// The rules below are CommonMark's, and the two that look arbitrary are not:
//
//   - LEFT- AND RIGHT-FLANKING decide whether a run may open or close, by what sits on either
//     side of it. It is what makes `a*b*c` emphasis and `a * b * c` three asterisks, and what
//     makes `_` behave differently from `*` inside a word: `snake_case_name` keeps its
//     underscores while `snake*case*name` does not.
//   - THE RULE OF THREE. When a run could both open and close, a match is refused if the sum
//     of the two run lengths is a multiple of three and neither is itself. Without it,
//     `***a***b***` and its relatives parse differently depending on which end you start
//     from, and the spec has eleven examples that exist only to pin this down.
