// The tree, as the editor's document. The fifth direction, and the last.
//
// STRAIGHT TO PROSEMIRROR JSON, not to HTML for Tiptap to re-parse. `tiptap-markdown` goes the
// long way — markdown-it produces HTML, `setContent` parses that HTML back into nodes through
// every extension's `parseHTML` — and the trip costs more than time: whatever the HTML cannot
// say is lost at the join. A maths node has to be spelled as a `<span>` with attributes that
// the maths node will recognise, a table's alignment has to survive as an attribute on a `<td>`,
// and every one of those spellings is a second contract to keep in step with the first.
//
// The JSON is the schema itself, so there is nothing to spell and nothing to re-parse. The
// node and mark names below are the ones `editorExtensions.ts` mounts, and a name that drifts
// makes the editor refuse the document loudly rather than silently drop a node.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY FLATTENED. The editor has no node for a footnote definition, a
// callout or a link reference definition: all three live in the document as ordinary text and
// are given meaning by the renderer (`render/post-content.ts`) or by the block parser on the
// way back in. They are written here the way an author types them, which is what keeps them
// editable — and what keeps a save from inventing syntax the writer never saw.
