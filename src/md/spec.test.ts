//
// A RATCHET, not a pass/fail. Building a CommonMark implementation takes many sittings, and a
// suite that is red until the last one tells nobody anything on any of the days in between —
// so this one asserts against a FLOOR kept in `spec/floor.json` and goes red only when the
// count drops below it. Raising the floor is a deliberate line in a commit, which makes
// progress a thing the repository records rather than a thing somebody remembers.
//
// ⚠️ THE FLOOR MAY ONLY GO UP. Lowering it to make a red check green is the one move this
// file exists to prevent: it is how a rewrite quietly ships worse than what it replaced.
// If an example has to be given up, it goes in `DIVERGED` below with the reason written out,
// where it is visible and countable — and every entry there is a promise that somebody looked.

 * that could only be raised — a suite that stays red until the last sitting tells nobody
 * anything on any of the days in between. On 2026-09-13 the count reached every example that
 * is not deliberately diverged, and at that point a floor is the weaker statement: it would
 * let a later change lose three examples and stay green.

 * So the contract is now exact. Every example passes, or this is red and says which.
