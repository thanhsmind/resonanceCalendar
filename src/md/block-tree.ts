/**
 * HOW DEEP A DOCUMENT MAY NEST, in containers.
 *
 * Every line has to be offered to every open container in turn, so a document that opens one
 * more container on every line does work in the square of its own line count. The engine is
 * linear in bytes on that shape since the trim in `line.ts` was fixed, and this is the belt to
 * that brace: it bounds the per-line matching whatever the input does.
 *
 * A HUNDRED, and the number is measured rather than chosen. The deepest nesting in this blog's
 * 92 posts is 6. The deepest in CommonMark 0.31.2's own 652 examples is 6, and in GFM's 24 it
 * is 4. A hundred is more than ten times anything either specification or any real piece of
 * writing has needed here, and it is the number markdown-it has used for years, so a document
 * that trips it is a document no other engine would render either.
 *
 * At the ceiling a marker stops being a marker: the `>` or the `-` stays in the line and
 * becomes part of the text, which is what a reader would see from any capped parser.
