// The Markdown engine's front door (ADR 0052).
//
// Everything this blog does with Markdown comes through here, and the shape is the point:
// ONE parse, then a choice of renderer. Four engines used to answer this question separately
// — `marked` for the reader, `markdown-it` for opening a post, `prosemirror-markdown` for
// saving it, a run of regular expressions for the excerpt — and they drifted, which is what
// four answers to one question do.
//
// Nothing else in `src/` may parse Markdown.
