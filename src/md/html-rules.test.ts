// THE FOUR THINGS THE SPEC DOES NOT SAY, and one of them is a hole that was open.
//
// `spec.test.ts` measures the engine against CommonMark and GFM, and passes 672 of 676
// examples without ever looking at these rules — because no Markdown spec has an opinion
// about them. That is exactly why they need a file: a rule no spec measures is a rule that
// disappears quietly, and the first of the four is what stands between a comment box and a
// working `javascript:` link.
//
// Each test below names the v1 behaviour it is holding, because `render/post-content.ts` is
// where all four have lived until now and the engine has to arrive carrying them.
//
// IT DRIVES A LOCAL BUNDLE RATHER THAN THIS BLOG'S. `render/page-rules.ts` is the blog's set
// and it holds two functions the engine may not own — a slug function that knows Vietnamese
// and a LaTeX engine — so a suite inside the engine that reached for it would be the one
// import standing between `src/md` and its own repository. What is measured here is the
// engine's half: that each rule does what it says when a host asks for it, and the spec's
// answer when nobody does. The blog's own answers are measured next door.
