// This blog's own notation, as two matchers: the pen's three gestures and the four maths
// delimiters.
//
// Neither grammar is written here. `pen/grammar.ts` and `md/math-syntax.ts` own them and
// every parser in this repository reads them from there — which is the whole reason those
// files exist. Four parsers once spelled `==text==` out separately and two of them drifted
// within the hour, putting the word "green" into every excerpt on the site.
//
// Split from `inline.ts` at the 400-line ceiling. The seam is a fair one: everything here is
// notation this blog invented, and everything left there is Markdown.

/**
 * A formula at `pos`, in any of the four delimiters.
 *
 * ⚠️ A PRICE IS NOT A FORMULA, and the dollar form needs one guard more than the shared
 * matcher gives it. `math-syntax.ts` carries Pandoc's three rules — no space after the opening
 * `$`, none before the closing one, no digit after it — and they are enough for `$5 và $10`.
 * They were not enough for this, found on a real post on 2026-09-13:
 *
 *     có giá **200-300$** sẽ vẫn tăng trưởng … là set **300$** và hiện giờ
 *
 * Both dollars pass all three guards, so the span from the first to the second swallowed the
 * sentence between them and rendered it as maths. `marked` never had the problem because it
 * resolves `**` into a token first and parses the inner run on its own; this parser keeps
 * emphasis on a stack until the end, so the text is still one piece when the dollar is met.
 *
 * The guard is the observation that makes it safe: `**` and `__` are Markdown emphasis and TeX
 * has no use for either — it writes powers with `^`. A span carrying one is a sentence with
 * prices in it. The shared matcher is deliberately NOT changed: `marked` and the editor read it
 * too, and neither has this bug.
