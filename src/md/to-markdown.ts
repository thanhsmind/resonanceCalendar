// The tree, back as Markdown. The dangerous direction.
//
// Every other renderer here produces something a reader looks at once. This one produces the
// FILE — what a save writes over the author's words — and a bug in it does not show up as a
// broken page. It shows up as a sentence that is not there any more, on a post somebody
// published months ago, discovered by nobody.
//
// That is not hypothetical. `editor-corpus.test.ts` records it: 19 of 45 golden fixtures
// published differently after a single pass through the editor, because the serializer
// escaped `[^1]` into `\[^1\]` — which the renderer then read as LaTeX display maths, so a
// footnote reference became an empty formula in the middle of a sentence. And the quadratic
// stall that started this whole engine was in the same library, doing the same job.
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE IS WRITTEN TO: parse(serialize(tree)) must equal tree. Not "looks the
// same" — the same tree. A round trip is the only test that can catch a serializer dropping
// something, because the dropped thing is invisible in the output by definition. The suite
// runs it over the golden corpus and over this blog's real posts.
//
// Escaping is the other half. A serializer that escapes too little corrupts on the next read;
// one that escapes too much fills the source with backslashes nobody typed, and an author who
// opens their own post and finds `\*` where they wrote `*` stops trusting the editor. The
// rule here is: escape a character only where it could START something on the way back in.

 * anywhere. Each survives a save and a reopen as two cells with the same page.
