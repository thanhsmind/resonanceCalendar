// Accent-aware matching: the rule that lets one search box answer two kinds of typing.
//
// The FTS5 index folds diacritics (`remove_diacritics 2`, `store/schema.sql`) so that
// somebody typing "lap trinh" with no Vietnamese keyboard still finds "lập trình". Folding
// the QUERY the same way throws away something the person did type. In Vietnamese a tone
// mark is a letter and not a decoration: "lề" (margin), "lệ" (rule), "lê" (pear), "lẻ"
// (odd) and "lễ" (ceremony) are five words. Measured on 2026-09-11: a search for the first
// returned every one of them, with the wrong word highlighted in the passage under the row.
//
// The rule, applied per WORD: a word typed WITHOUT accents matches any accents in the text,
// which is what folding is for. A word typed WITH them means them.
//
// This is not a second index. The folded index still finds the candidates and this narrows
// them afterwards, so there is no migration and nothing to reindex: an accented query reads
// a few more rows and drops the ones that only matched with their accents taken off.
//
// The narrowing asks for a WHOLE word, the same run of letters and digits the tokenizer
// cuts. A substring test was tried first and measured on the live blog on 2026-09-11: it
// left "lê" returning 50 of 50, because "lê" sits inside "lên" and almost every Vietnamese
// post contains that. The exception is the scripts that put no spaces between words — a
// whole-word test would answer "no" to every true hit in Japanese or Chinese, so a word
// written in one of those is matched as a substring instead.
