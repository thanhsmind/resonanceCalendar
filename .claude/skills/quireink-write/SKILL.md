# Working a Quire Ink blog over MCP

Every tool below is a thin wrapper over the same functions the admin calls: same slug
rules, same revisions, same soft delete, same activity log. Nothing you do here is a
side door, which also means nothing you break here is invisible to the owner.

Tool internals: [`docs/mcp.md`](../../../docs/mcp.md). Worked prompts:
[`docs/agent-cookbook.md`](../../../docs/agent-cookbook.md).

## Before the first call

MCP is **off until the owner turns it on** (Admin → Settings → Server & connections → MCP) and
issues a token. Tokens are shown once, hashed after that, and **expire 180 days after
creation**. A 401 on every call usually means one of those two things, not a bug worth
debugging: ask the owner to check the toggle and the token's age.

## The surface, in the order you will reach for it

**Writing.** `create_post` `update_post` `patch_post` `get_post` `list_posts`
`delete_post` · `create_page` `update_page` `get_page` `list_pages` `delete_page` ·
`list_categories` `list_tags`

**The notebook.** `list_notes` `get_note` `create_note` `update_note` `delete_note`
`restore_note` · `list_mentions`. A note is a third kind of writing, kept apart from the
posts: it never joins the feed, the front page or the newsletter, and lives under
`/notes/{slug}` in its own namespace. A note with `sourceUrl` is a clip — pass `sourceUrl`,
`sourceTitle` and `quote` as fields, never folded into the body, because a clip that names
its source sends a Webmention to it when published. `list_mentions` answers two questions:
which pages elsewhere link here, and which passages readers keep most.

**The site itself.** `compose_homepage` (the composed front: lead, picks, category rows,
most-read) · `update_appearance` (palette, fonts, sizes) · `get_settings` ·
`list_settings` (every setting that can be changed: path, type, value now — call it to FIND
a path rather than guessing one) · `update_settings` (any of those paths; it wrote three
fields before 2.2.4). Two are worth naming before you change them, because they affect every
page a reader loads: `customCss` and `siteUrl`.

**Media and files.** `add_media_from_url` `list_media` `delete_media` · `import_images`
(one batch per call: fetch images still loading from other hosts into the library and
rewrite the references; loop until `remaining` is 0, stop early on `moved: 0`) ·
`list_files` `delete_file`

**Reading the blog.** `get_traffic` `get_post_traffic` `get_audience` `search_posts`
(the owner's own full-text search, drafts included) `get_update_status`

**Stewarding.** `list_comments` `reply_comment` `delete_comment` · `create_snapshot`
(a backup) · `send_test_newsletter` · the trash: `list_trashed_posts`
`list_trashed_pages` `list_trashed_media` `list_trashed_files` and the matching
`restore_post` `restore_page` `restore_media` `restore_file`

## What is deliberately not here

**Subscriber email addresses, and commenters' emails and IPs, are unreachable over MCP,
ever.** `get_audience` returns counts. An agent stewarding a blog needs numbers and words,
not identities. There is no tool that broadcasts a newsletter to real subscribers
(`send_test_newsletter` goes to the owner) and none that mints a token. If a task seems to
need one of those, say so and hand it back — do not look for a way around it.

## House rules for writing

- **Draft by default.** Create as a draft and say it is waiting, unless the user asked for
  it live. Publishing is one edit away for them; unpublishing something readers already saw
  is not.
- **Write Markdown, in their voice.** Read two or three of their recent posts with
  `get_post` before writing the first one. The blog stores Markdown, so what you write is
  what is kept, not a conversion of it.
- **Slugs are the site's memory.** Renaming one leaves a redirect behind automatically, but
  do not rename slugs in bulk to tidy them. Old links in other people's posts are the point.
- **Excerpt, categories, tags, every time.** They drive the front page, the rails and search.
  An audit that finds them missing is the most common real job on this blog.
- **Deleting is soft.** Everything lands in Trash and the owner can restore it. You cannot
  destroy anything permanently; only they can, in the admin. This is not a reason to be
  casual — a trashed post is off the site immediately.

## Jobs worth knowing by shape

- **The Monday report.** `get_traffic` for 7 days against the 7 before, then plain words:
  what was read, where from, what grew, what fell — and one suggestion for the next post
  based on which existing posts still pull readers.
- **The archive audit.** Walk published posts; report missing excerpts, categories and
  tags, plus pairs that cover overlapping ground and should link to each other. Report
  first, change nothing until told.
- **The moderation sweep.** `list_comments`, flag spam or abuse **with the reason**, and
  trash only after the owner confirms. Comments already pass a gate the blog runs itself
  (ADR 0032), so what reaches the queue is what got through it, not the raw firehose.
- **The front page.** `compose_homepage` curates the composed front the owner designed.
  Order the rows by what people actually read; do not invent a new layout for them.
- **Before anything destructive**, `create_snapshot`.

## Do not

- Do not publish, delete or email on your own initiative. Drafts and reports are yours;
  anything a reader would see is theirs.
- Do not paste the MCP token into a file, a commit, or a message. If you have seen one, it
  is already too widely known — tell the owner to rotate it.
- Do not fabricate figures. If `get_traffic` returns nothing for a window, say the window is
  empty; a blog with no readers yet is a fact, not an error to paper over.
