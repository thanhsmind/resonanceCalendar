# CHANGELOG

## 2026-09-25 · Quire Ink 2.2.15

Two days after 2.2.14, and one feature that was asked for in an issue: a post can go out
without a title. Plus the fix for the kind tabs in the writing list, which filtered the list
correctly and kept the marker under the wrong word.

### A post can have no title (ADR 0064)

A short thought, a link with a line under it, a small update: leave the title empty and
publish. It is a post in every other respect, with its own address, a place in the blog's list,
both feeds, tags and categories, and the newsletter. Notes stay what they were: a notebook kept
out of the feed.

- **Its address is its first six words**, `/just-shipped-the-new-reading-mode`, fixed at the
  first save.
- **It is drawn by its words, never by a headline made from them.** The article has no
  headline. In the list the date is the link to it, the way a microblog does it. The front page
  shows its words, linked. The newsletter shows its words under the date.
- **The RSS and JSON Feed items carry no title**, which both formats allow, so a feed reader
  shows the words. A JSON Feed item without a title carries them as its text.
- **Where only a name fits, it is called by its first words**, cut at about 70 characters: the
  browser tab, the share card, the schema headline, read next, related posts, a series, the
  archive, the sidebar, search and `llms.txt`.
- **The editor, the admin API and the MCP `create_post` tool accept a post that is only words.**
  Pages and notes still need a name.

### Fixed

- **An untitled draft was renamed on every save.** It had no address of its own to send, so
  each save made one up again (`post-` and the clock) and moved the draft to it. It now keeps
  the address it was first saved under.
- **The kind tabs in the writing list underlined "All" whatever was chosen** (issue #68). The
  list narrowed to posts, pages or notes and the marker stayed put, on a click and again on
  every return to the list. Broken since 2.2.13, when the list became a page the server draws.
  A browser flow now checks the marker itself, after a click and after a navigation.

### What 2.2.15 does not do

- **A short post shows its summary in the list and the feeds, not its whole body**, so a link
  inside it is plain text there. The post's own page has all of it.
- **The admin's writing list shows a short post as `(untitled) #n`**, with its words on the
  line under it.
- **A short post written entirely in Chinese, Japanese or Korean, or in emoji, is addressed by
  the clock** (`post-` and a number), as a title in those scripts always has been. The address
  can be changed in the post's attributes.

## 2026-09-23 · Quire Ink 2.2.14

Three days after 2.2.13, and most of it is about the machine underneath. The smallest box this
runs on went from 256 MB to 192 MB, and a blog of 1,000 posts no longer gets killed for memory
on a 128 MB container. The backup archive, which carries every credential the blog holds, can
now leave the machine sealed. An upgrade copies the database before it changes it. And the four
looks stop reading as one page in four costumes. Sealed backups ship switched off on every
install and on this upgrade; the section says where the switch is.

### It fits on a small machine

**The image codec runs in a child process now, one per variant** ([ADR 0061](docs/decisions/0061-the-image-codec-runs-in-a-child-process.md)).
libvips does not hand memory back: six variants from one photograph climb a process from 51 MB
to 136 and leave it there, permanently, in a server that runs for months. That climb, not
serving, is what killed small installations — a blog of 33 posts and 18 pictures was OOM-killed
at 128, 160 **and** 192 MB, two minutes after a boot that had looked healthy, because two
minutes is when the first tick sweeps for pending variants.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| the floor | 256 MB | **192 MB** |
| at 192 MB | OOM-killed | runs, 90 to 93 MB |
| six variants | 1,708 ms | 1,821 ms |

⚠️ **The shape of the failure changed, and that is worth more than the 64 MB.** A run that still
hit the limit logged `encode 1600.avif exited null (SIGKILL)` while `/api/health` answered 200,
the database and store both fine, and the pending pictures waited for the next tick. The kernel
killed the encoder; the blog kept serving. Before this the same pressure killed the server and
left nothing in the log to say why.

**AVIF is encoded at effort 3 rather than sharp's default of 4.** Measured over twelve
photographs, the 1600px copy: 6,888 ms against 28,528 ms, the same number of bytes, and 0.24 dB
of PSNR. Four times the work for a quarter of a decibel. ⚠️ Read that as the PSNR column and not
the size column: on bytes alone effort **1** looks best of all and is in fact 1.05 dB worse on
every image, which is a wrong conclusion this nearly shipped.

Four cheaper answers were measured and rejected: `sequentialRead` (worse), `VIPS_DISC_THRESHOLD`
(no change), a file path instead of a buffer (2 MB), and `sharp.concurrency(1)` — which is a
no-op, because libvips already reports concurrency 1 inside a container.


**It runs `bun --smol` now**, everywhere the process is started: the image, `bun start`,
`install.sh` and the systemd unit. JavaScriptCore sizes its heap from the MACHINE's memory and
cannot see a container limit, so inside `--memory=128m` on an 8 GB host it believed it had 8 GB
and let garbage pile up until the limit stopped it. Measured on the demo fixture, 33 posts and
18 pictures, at `--memory=128m --cpus=0.25`:

| | memory | boot warm | the home page |
|---|---|---|---|
| before | 121.5 MB of 128, pinned at 100% CPU | **unfinished after twenty minutes** | 16.5 s |
| now | **55.1 MB**, 0.05% CPU | 379 ms | 5 ms |

⚠️ It was never OOM-killed in that state, so nothing restarted it: the container reported
healthy while the site was effectively down. The same fixture given 512 MB and the same quarter
CPU warmed in 1.6 seconds, which is what says the work was never the problem.

It is not a concession either. 3,000 requests at 32 concurrent on 2 GB and 2 CPUs: 4,995 and
5,115 req/s before, **5,962 and 6,234 after**, p50 5.4 ms against 4.3. A compact heap collects
less and fits in cache.

**What the machine has to be: 192 MB and any one CPU, and 256 MB is what to give it.** Serving
costs 56 MB and answers a page in 5 to 37 ms on a quarter of a CPU. What needs the rest is
cutting the smaller copies of an uploaded picture, which at 192 MB may have one encode killed
and retried (the table above). A blog with no pictures runs in half of it. Written down in
[self-host](docs/self-host.md) and [delivery](docs/delivery.md#the-budget), where it was not
written down before.


A 1,000-post blog in a 128 MB container was **OOM-killed on two of three restarts**, and the
cause was the cache warmer: it rendered every public post into memory at boot and after every
write, whether or not anybody had ever asked for one. Measured at `--memory=128m --cpus=0.25`
— 977 pages held, 117.6 MB of 128, and 74.6 seconds of a quarter CPU spent on every boot.

- **The page cache is a budget now**, `PAGE_CACHE_MB`, 8 MB by default. The same box now sits
  at 90 MB and survives restarts. `0` keeps nothing; raise it if the machine is generous.
- **A blog of ordinary size cannot tell the difference.** 100 posts of that fixture come to
  2.4 MB — the whole archive still fits, and nothing is ever evicted.
- **What it gives up is stated rather than hidden:** an article the cache no longer holds is
  rendered on request, which measured 46 to 98 ms on that same quarter of a CPU, against about
  10 ms from the cache. The rendered body is still cached on disk (`render_cache`), so what a
  reader pays for is the page around it, not the Markdown.
- Eviction is least-recently-**read**, so a crawler walking the archive cannot push the front
  page out, and the warm refuses a page rather than evicting one it already rendered.
- **Shiki is no longer loaded at boot.** The grammars were already on demand; the engine and
  the language index were not, so every install paid 20.7 MB and 151 ms for a syntax
  highlighter before serving a request, and a blog that writes no code paid it forever. It
  arrives on the first fence that names a language — and after a restart usually never, since
  the rendered body comes back from disk.

### The archive can leave sealed (ADR 0060)

The backup archive is the one thing here that leaves the machine, and it is a `VACUUM INTO` of
both databases: it carries `smtp_pass`, the AI key, the Cloudflare token, the S3 pair,
`users.totp_secret`, the fediverse actor's private key and every subscriber's address. It goes
up into somebody else's bucket and down onto a laptop. Nothing said so.

- ⚠️ **Off at install and off on every upgrade.** Settings, Server and connections, Backups. It
  cannot be switched on until there are keys to seal to.
- **The server cannot open what it seals.** Both recipients are public halves: an identity shown
  once and never stored, and a second keypair derived from a passphrase that is also never
  stored. A passphrase kept on the box so the schedule can run unattended is a passphrase
  whoever owns the box now also has, and the switch would have looked identical while protecting
  nothing.
- **Two keys, because a file can be lost and a memory can be forgotten.** Either opens any
  archive. ⚠️ Lose both and a sealed archive cannot be opened, by anyone. The card says so in a
  warning that survives the explanations being switched off.
- One switch covers all three copies: the snapshots on disk, the off-site object, and the
  download. The Markdown export stays in the clear, because it carries no credential by design
  and is the path for "I just want my writing".
- `bun scripts/backup-decrypt.ts <archive> --identity <file>` or `--passphrase` opens one with
  nothing running, and the tool ships inside the image: a restore is a shell act on a stopped
  service (ADR 0035), so a decrypt tool that only existed in a git checkout would be a tool
  nobody has when they need it. The format is written out in ADR 0060 completely enough to
  rebuild a reader from the document alone.
- Our own envelope rather than `age`, and the reason was measured: **Bun ships no
  ChaCha20-Poly1305**, in `node:crypto` or in WebCrypto, so an age-compatible payload would need
  a hand-written stream cipher over the owner's whole blob store. AES-256-GCM in 64 KiB frames
  is 5.5 GB/s against 87 ms of the gzip that already happens. Measured through the real route on
  a 101 MB archive: 2,455 ms sealed against 2,444 ms in the clear.
- The ops script takes its recipients from `QUIRE_BACKUP_TO`: `blog` seals to the keys the
  Backups card set up, read from the database, so either key opens the archive. ⚠️ It seals the
  database tar only; that script syncs uploads as a tree with `rclone` rather than putting them
  in the archive.

### An upgrade copies your database before it changes it, and hands the space back after

Until now the only thing standing between a migration and your data was a line in the
documentation asking you to take a backup first. A boot with a pending migration writes one
itself now — `data/backups/pre-<step>-<stamp>-quire.db`, named for the step it is about to
run — and **if it cannot write that copy it exits instead of migrating**, telling you which
path and why. Nothing in your database changes until the copy exists. Two are kept; older
ones go as new ones are made, so this does not pile up.

Measured on a real 618 MB database: the copy takes 85 ms and is 8.8 MB, because it holds what
you wrote rather than what was cached.

And the disk comes back. SQLite gives freed pages to its own freelist rather than to the
operating system, so the change above would have left a 618 MB file holding 8.9 MB of content
and no way for you to tell it had worked. When a migration leaves a file mostly empty — over a
quarter free and more than 64 MB of it, so an ordinary upgrade does nothing — the boot
compacts it once: a verified copy is written, checked, and moved into place, never a `VACUUM`
over a live file.

### The four looks each read as their own kind of publication

- **Source code**: headlines — the piece's title, the titles in a feed and on the front page,
  and the section heads — are set in the monospace, bold. The paragraphs stay in the book face.
  Highlighted code blocks get line numbers, which a copy does not pick up.
- **Newspaper**: the section menu moves into the masthead on every page, including on a phone,
  where it scrolls sideways. On a piece, the contents and the series box each become one run of
  numbered entries, and the first letter is a drop cap. At 1440 × 1000 the first line of text
  moves up from y=980 to y=832.
- **Notebook**: the sheet is dot-grid paper, links are marked with a highlighter in the
  palette's accent, and the text is ragged right. The panel beside the piece is a square
  index card.
- **Fixed in Notebook**: the grey used for dates, the rail and small labels was broken for
  every blog wearing this look, so all of it printed in the full text colour. It had also
  hidden the hand-drawn series box and the section ticks, which show again now.
- **Settings → Appearance → Looks like** shows the four as drawn tiles, each with a line saying
  who it is for, in place of four names in a strip.

### The keyboard reaches two pictures it could not

A picture in a post opens its full-size viewer with Enter or Space, not only with a click, and the
library's full-size picture is a real dialog: focus goes into it, the page behind stops taking
Tab, and closing puts focus back where it was.

### The admin stops sending the pen to screens that have no paper

The pen's stylesheet — most of the admin's CSS — now loads only on the three writing screens. On
every other screen the stylesheet drops from 55 KB to 23 KB gzipped.

### The ops backup script leaves the caches out, and keeps its daily copies when sealed

`scripts/ops/quire-backup.sh` now empties the rebuildable caches in its snapshot, as the in-app
backup already did. If you set `QUIRE_BACKUP_TO`, your daily copies were being deleted after
three days instead of thirty; that is fixed. `QUIRE_BACKUP_AGE_TO` seals the archive with `age`
instead (see `docs/backups.md`).

### The database cache stops promising more memory than the box has

SQLite was told it could keep 64 MB of pages per connection, and there are two connections —
so a blog this software also ships in a 128 MB container was promised 128 MB by one setting
alone. It is now 16 MB, which on a small box is **faster as well as smaller**. Measured against
a 314 MB database, 20,000 reads, three runs each, in a 128 MB container:

| Cache | Memory added | Time |
|---|---|---|
| 64 MB | +57 MB | 181 / 189 / 188 ms |
| **16 MB** | **+43 MB** | **142 / 146 / 132 ms** |
| 8 MB | +26 to +35 MB | 142 / 81 / 104 ms |

Not a paradox: inside a memory limit, SQLite's own cache and the operating system's page cache
come out of the same allowance, so a large private cache buys a second copy of pages it has
just pushed the system into dropping. On a machine with room, all four settings were
indistinguishable, so nothing is given up on a big server either.

If your database is smaller than the cache — which it is, for almost every blog — nothing about
this is observable: the whole file was held before and is held now.

### Fixed: half a gigabyte of rendered HTML nobody could reach

The cache that holds a rendered post was keyed by the render rather than by the post, and the
build commit is part of that key — so every deploy made every cached body unreachable and left
it there for a thirty-day sweep to find. Measured on a blog that deploys about seven times a
day:

| | |
|---|---|
| The database | 618 MB |
| The cache inside it | 20,001 rows, **502 MB** |
| Distinct HTML in those rows | about **5.6 MB** |
| Everything anybody had written — 93 posts, revisions, settings, log | **8 MB** |

One rendered post of 88,084 characters was in there **204 times**, byte for byte.

Nothing was wrong with the renders and nothing was wrong with the sweep. The shape had no way
to say *replace*: the only identifying column was a hash, so a new render had no old row to
address. A post keeps one row now, and a fresh render takes it. The same hash still decides
whether a render is reused, on exactly the inputs it used before, so a reader receives the
same bytes as before — the table simply stops growing with deploys.

Highlighted code blocks are unchanged: a block is shared between posts, so it has no post to
belong to, and age remains the right way to retire one.

### Fixed: a sealed archive was pinned to the build that wrote it

The encrypted archive's header has always carried the key-stretching cost — `n`, `r` and `p` —
and the reader took only the salt out of it and the other three from its own constants. So the
format described itself and was pinned to one build in fact: **raising the cost would have
orphaned every archive already written**, failing with `no-matching-key`, which reads to whoever
is holding it as "wrong passphrase". On the worst day, about the one file meant to survive it.

The reader takes all four from the archive now, and bounds them, because that header is parsed
before any key exists and so cannot have been authenticated: `n` must be a power of two in
2^14…2^20, `r` and `p` in 1…16. An archive asking for `n: 2^30` is asking the person restoring
it to allocate a terabyte.

The cost this build writes is unchanged at N=65536. Measured in a container, scrypt wants 64 MB
there and 128 MB at N=2^17; the floor this software is documented to run on is 192 MB and the
server is 56 MB of it, so the larger number would leave nothing for anything else.

### Fixed: opening and saving a post no longer closes up a spaced list

A list with a blank line between its items shows every item as a paragraph, with a paragraph's
space around it. Opening such a post in the editor and saving it wrote the list without the blank
lines, and the space went with them. Measured over 142 published posts opened and saved: two
changed on the page, both for this reason. The editor now remembers that a list was spaced.

### Fixed: a list mixing bullets and checkboxes stays one list when saved

`- a` followed by `- [ ] b` is one list. Opening and saving it wrote two lists instead, and on a
spaced list each item lost its paragraph spacing. It is now saved as the one list it was, tight
or spaced; two lists with something written between them stay two.

### Fixed: a save no longer turns a literal dollar or tilde into maths or strikethrough

Text you had escaped — `\$x\$`, `\~~b~~`, or three tildes at the start of a line after a line
break — was saved without its backslash, so the next open read it as a formula, a strikethrough
or a code fence. It is now escaped exactly where it would otherwise change meaning, so a price
like `$5 and $6` or an approximate `~5 minutes` is still saved as you typed it.

### Fixed: summaries show escaped characters without the backslash

Excerpts, meta descriptions, social cards and RSS summaries printed the backslashes a saved post
carries: `snake\_case` as `snake\ case`, `TBWA\Chiat\Day` with each backslash doubled. They
now show the character that was escaped. Existing summaries update the next time a post is
saved.

### Fixed: the Markdown view showed a long piece as a stub

Paste a four-thousand-word draft into the Markdown view and it landed intact, saved intact, and
showed as a stub. Switching to the writing showed every word, so nothing was lost — the box
simply kept the height it had when the view opened.

⚠️ **It was not only a short box.** The textarea has no scrollbar by design, so everything past
its bottom edge was unreachable by any means: typing at the end walked your own caret out of
sight. The height is measured on every change now. The flow that holds it reports, without the
fix, `after a paste, 9072px of the piece is unreachable below the box`.

### Fixed: a stranger scanning your blog stopped filling your error log

Every request that answered 4xx was written to the error stream. On a blog reachable from the
open internet that is mostly somebody's scanner asking for `/wp-config.backup`, `/.env.backup1`
or `/backup.sql` — each of which correctly answers 404, and each of which then read in your
log as something this software had got wrong. Measured over seven days of one live instance:
29,787 lines, of which 18,483 were a 404 logged as an error, against **twelve** real failures.

A 4xx still gets a line with its status and its duration, because on a single-tenant blog the
log is the monitoring. It is simply no longer filed as a fault of the blog's. A 5xx — the one
status that means this software broke — still goes to the error stream, and a refused sign-in
is still recorded in the activity log where you can see it.

### Fixed: the writing list stretched its lines to 140 characters

The list of everything written had no maximum width below 1280px, so it took whatever the window
gave it. Measured in a browser, walking the excerpt's own font:

| 390px | 600px | 768px | 900px | 1100px | 1279px |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 41ch | 68ch | 86ch | 101ch | 116ch | **140ch** |

`docs/conventions/type.md` puts the reading measure at 45 to 75. It was worst between 1024 and
1279 — a 13-inch laptop — where the rail is forced shut and hands the list every pixel it gave
up, so the window that makes the chrome smallest made the text longest. It holds at 80
characters now, centred.

### Fixed: the settings refusal line was drawn in the body colour

The sentence that says a value was rejected used two classes that have no rule behind them, so
it rendered `oklch(0.205 0 none)` — the body colour, to the last digit, on the one line whose
whole job is to look unlike ordinary prose. It uses the admin's own danger token now: 4.87:1 in
light, 6.09:1 in dark.

`check:admin-css` exists to catch exactly that and was green throughout, because it reads
`className=` and `class="…"` and this file keeps its classes in a named constant. It reads those
too now — 641 class names checked before, 783 after — behind a gate that keeps URLs, storage keys
and event names out of it. Its first run found one more: `write-row`, on every row of the list,
styled by no rule and selected by nothing.

### What 2.2.14 does not do

- **A sealed archive with both keys lost cannot be opened by anyone**, including this software.
  The ops script seals the database tar only; it copies uploads as a tree and does not seal them.
- **The pre-upgrade copy sits on the same disk as the database.** It protects against a
  migration, not against losing the machine: that is still what an off-site backup is for.
- **At 192 MB an image encode can be killed** and is retried on the next tick, so a new picture's
  smaller copies may arrive a few minutes late. 256 MB is what to give it.
- **A look carries no colour of its own**, by design: the palette decides. The newspaper's section
  and figure numbers exist on the page only, not in the feed, a newsletter or a copied quote.
- **A code block shows no file name or language label**, and one holding a single blank line is
  saved as an empty block: the editor cannot tell the two apart.

## 2026-09-20 · Quire Ink 2.2.13

The largest release since 2.2.10, and most of it is about letting the writing out: the blog can
be followed from Mastodon, read by a program, and downloaded as Markdown another tool can open.
A piece can also say what language it is written in, which is the first time anything here could
say that an essay is in English while the blog is in Vietnamese. Two of the new doors ship
switched off on every install and two more ship off on an upgrade; each says so below.

### The blog can be followed, from anywhere that speaks ActivityPub (ADR 0059)

WebFinger, an actor, an inbox taking Follow and Undo, an outbox, HTTP Signatures both ways, and
a delivery to every follower when a post is published, changed or withdrawn. A reader on
Mastodon can follow this blog where they already read, which is a different act from subscribing
to a feed rather than a worse one.

- ⚠️ **Off at install and off on every upgrade.** Settings, Server and connections, Fediverse.
  This door differs in kind from the others: switching it on gives the blog an identity in a
  network of other people's servers, with a name, a keypair, and a list of strangers who asked
  to hear from it. That is not a display option to acquire because the software updated
  overnight.
- It refuses to run with no handle and with no site address. A default handle would be an
  identity chosen for the owner; with no site address the actor's id would say `localhost`, and
  every signed delivery would be verified against a key fetched from the follower's own machine.
- The handle is not the login username, and it cannot change. The handle and the address
  together are the actor's id, cached by every server that follows the blog: change either and
  the old actor stops existing for them, with nothing anywhere saying where it went.
- Nothing hooks `savePost`. A post can become public three ways and stop being public two more,
  so a sweep compares the public posts against a ledger instead: no row is a Create, a changed
  digest an Update, a missing post a Delete. The cutoff is the moment the keypair was made, so a
  blog with ten years of writing does not hand a decade of posts to whoever follows it that
  afternoon.
- The inbox takes a signature or nothing, checked against a key fetched from the actor it claims
  to be, and the signer and the actor must be the same party. Without that second check anybody
  holding a valid key could add or remove any follower they liked.
- The followers collection is a count. The people who follow a blog did not agree to appear in a
  list on it.
- Switching the feature off does not delete the key. An identity in the fediverse is its key;
  off means the doors stop answering, which the owner can take back. Losing four hundred
  followers is not.
- ⚠️ **WebFinger fails in a way nothing here can see.** It lives under `/.well-known/`, and the
  common nginx ACME recipe claims that whole prefix with no `proxy_pass`, so the blog federates
  perfectly in testing and is unfindable in production with no error on either side.
  `docs/agent-ready.md` carries the narrowed form and now names the symptom.
- v1 publishes and does not read. Replies, likes and boosts reach the inbox and are dropped: a
  reply becoming a comment is a moderation question before it is a protocol one, and the comment
  system here has answers for its own readers and none for the fediverse.

### The blog can be read by a program (ADR 0057)

`/api/v1` answers with posts, pages, notes and the terms as JSON, carrying the Markdown each
piece was written in. Until now the only way to build a second front end, a search index, a
static export or a link checker was to fetch every page as HTML and parse it back out, which is
worse for the client and worse for the server.

- ⚠️ **Off at install and off on every upgrade.** Settings, Server and connections, Content API.
  The API publishes no new fact, since everything it serves is already fetchable by browsing. It
  publishes a shape: the whole blog in as many requests as it has pages instead of as many as it
  has readers. Whether that suits a particular blog is the owner's judgement.
- 404 while off rather than 403, so nothing confirms the feature exists on this install.
- Read only, so the file appears nowhere in the write gate's exception list, and no route reads
  the session: the owner is served byte for byte what a stranger is served.
- The projection names every field it emits rather than spreading a stored row, so a column
  added next year reaches the public API only when somebody writes its name there. `deletedAt`,
  `metaTitle`, `metaDescription` and the raw translation key stay behind, and so does `status`,
  because a field that always reads the same is a field a future leak could hide behind.

### A piece can say what language it is written in (ADR 0056)

The admin speaks eleven languages and the reading site speaks eleven languages. A post spoke
none: one setting went into `<html lang>` on every page. That attribute picks the hyphenation
dictionary, the quote marks a browser draws, the CJK face a system falls back to, and the voice
a screen reader reads in, so the reader it was most wrong for was the one listening.

- Two columns on posts and pages: the language, and the group a piece's translations share. From
  them come `<html lang>`, an hreflang set, the sitemap's alternates, and one line under the
  title linking to the other languages.
- ⚠️ **A piece with no language is not English.** It is "nobody has said", which is what every
  row written before this has, and those rows render exactly as they always did. Only a piece
  that names its language can be half of a pair, so a blog that has never touched this cannot be
  given a wrong pair by accident.
- A group, not a pointer. A pointer stored as a slug breaks the day that slug is renamed, and
  three languages are a graph rather than a chain.
- The switcher's label is in the piece's language and every link carries `lang` as well as
  `hreflang`. A screen reader in a Vietnamese document pronounces "English" as Vietnamese unless
  the element says otherwise, which is the one way a language switcher is worse than none.
- A listing marks each piece too, so a Korean headline in a Vietnamese feed is set in the right
  face and read aloud in the right voice. On the piece's own words only: the date, the category
  and the reading time beside them stay the site speaking.
- **What this is not: a site that follows its pieces.** The menu, the footer, the dates and the
  reading times stay in the site's language on every page, because making a whole page follow
  its piece means a route, a listing, a feed, a sitemap and a front page per language. ADR 0056
  says why half of that would be worse than neither.

### The writing leaves as Markdown, and comes back the same way (ADR 0055)

This software imported from WordPress, Ghost, Substack and Medium and exported to none of them.
The only way out was a tar.gz of two SQLite files, which restores this blog and which nothing
else on earth can read. That is lock-in arrived at by omission.

- A ZIP beside the backup, in the same card: every post, page and note as a Markdown file with
  front matter, the uploads file for file, the settings whole, and a README saying what the
  bundle is for whoever opens it in ten years.
- There is a reader for it, and that is the point. An export whose losslessness is nobody's job
  stops being lossless quietly, so the bundle is a fourth shape the importer recognises and a
  test exports a blog, empties it, and imports the file back through the route the owner presses.
- No credential leaves. The settings go in whole rather than as a hand-picked list of fields, and
  a test plants three secrets and looks for them.
- Image paths are left exactly as the body holds them. The bundle's README says the one thing
  that needs saying: put `uploads/` at a web root.

### A paragraph holding nothing but a link becomes a card (ADR 0058)

A YouTube link has been a player here since the port, and every other link alone on its line
stayed a line of blue text with an address in it, which is what a citation looks like when the
author meant go and look at this. Now a link to writing elsewhere gets a title, a description
and a picture, and a link to an uploaded PDF looks like a download instead of like a web page.

- ⚠️ **On for a new blog, off for a blog that already exists.** Settings, Posts, What is on a
  post. The bookmark card is the one that reaches out: turning it on means a save notes the URL
  and a background tick reads that page once, to learn its title and take a copy of its picture.
  That is a thing to be asked rather than told.
- The Markdown does not change. The line the author wrote stays a bare URL, portable and read as
  a link by every other renderer, which is what lets either card be switched off without
  touching a piece of writing.
- The picture is brought home and re-encoded, never hotlinked, so no third party learns who is
  reading this blog. It is written under `cards/` rather than into the media library, because
  fifty links would otherwise be fifty things to scroll past that the owner never uploaded.
- A row is fetched once, ever. This blog does not quietly re-crawl a list of other people's
  pages every week on the owner's behalf.

### The notebook can be subscribed to, and every feed comes in two formats

A note is never in the post feed, which is the point of it, and it also meant the one kind of
writing here that speaks IndieAuth, Micropub and Webmention was the one kind nobody could
subscribe to. There are four subscription documents now: `/feed.xml`, `/feed.json`,
`/notes/feed.xml` and `/notes/feed.json`, all on the one existing feed switch. The per-archive
feeds stay RSS only: sixty tag feeds in two formats is a hundred and twenty documents to keep in
step for a format nothing polls.

### Several pieces at once, in one request instead of fifty

The write column has had a selection mode since the port with nowhere to send it, so fifty ticks
were fifty parallel deletes, each flushing the page cache, purging the CDN and leaving a row in
the activity log. One press was fifty flushes, fifty purges and fifty rows.

- One request now, with Publish and Draft beside the bin. A blog that has been away for a season
  is a column of drafts, and the way to put six of them live was to open six posts.
- Shift fills the range and select all is one key. Both mean what is shown, because the rows all
  ship and the island hides them: "all" taken literally would publish two hundred rows of which
  the owner can see twelve.
- ⚠️ A status flip pushes no revision. Only three revisions are kept per post, so publishing
  fifty drafts would have replaced the owner's real earlier drafts with three copies of the
  current body differing by one word, silently, on fifty posts at once.

### A few improvements

- **The library shows each kind as a grid or as a list, and remembers which.** Pictures were a
  grid and files were a list with no way to ask for the other. Each kind keeps its own key and
  its own default, because a PDF's useful facts are its name, its size and its date, which is a
  row.
- **The analytics screen says which days of the week readers come.** It could say what happened
  on a given day, and how one year compared with the last, and nothing in between, so an owner
  deciding when to publish had the answer in front of them thirty times over with no way to add
  it up. Folded out of the chart's own buckets, so it costs no query, and the week opens on the
  day the reader's language opens it on.
- **The chart no longer reads as a collapse every morning.** Every window ends at now, so the
  last column held a few hours against neighbours holding a whole day: 65, 65, 64 and then 3.
  The bucket still being counted is reached by a dashed segment and named in the legend.
- **Every piece now lists the pieces that are not in the top ten**, which is what that table
  exists for. Its first ten rows were the ten titles printed directly above it.
- **The Trash draws 100 rows of the open kind and the people list draws 200 subscribers**, with
  the page in the address. A single bulk delete is how the Trash gets big, and a newsletter is
  the one list here that grows without anybody deciding to grow it. The counts beside the tabs
  and above the table stay the whole list, because "how many" is what the screen is opened for.
- **The activity log opens on a hundred rows** rather than fifty. They were already in the
  markup, so this is no round trip and no second query.
- **The owner's portrait moved out of the picture library** into Files, where the favicon and the
  app icon already are. It had been sorted among the photographs in their posts and offered by
  the picker every time they reached for an illustration.
- **The image carries 4.1 MB less.** The runtime stage copies `src` whole, so it was copying
  the workshop with it: 291 test files, the admin's browser half as TypeScript beside the
  bundle built from it, and the reader's islands likewise. Measured inside the published
  2.2.12: `src` is 10.9 MB of which none of that 4.1 MB is reachable at runtime. The layer
  goes 2.97 MB compressed to 2.03, and the published image 85.8 MB to 85.1, read off Docker
  Hub once 2.2.13 was pushed.
- The pager moved into the shared admin kit, so the three screens that have one cannot disagree
  about what it looks like.
- Eleven languages, four sets of quotation marks and one apostrophe spelled two ways: 193 strings
  across 18 files, each language to its own convention rather than to one rule. A thirteenth
  static guard holds it, and nothing else in this repository would ever have gone red over any
  of it.
- The Vietnamese admin lost four English words it was using in a file that says "thanh bên"
  thirteen times, and a radio button that read "as before" to readers who never saw before.

### Fixed

#### Writing and readers

- **One post's title could stop every subscriber's reader.** XML 1.0 admits tab, newline and
  carriage return and nothing else below U+0020, and a conforming reader rejects the document
  rather than the item. So a single post whose title carried a stray vertical tab took the whole
  feed off the air, and the owner saw nothing wrong: HTML takes the same character without
  complaint, so the post's own page looked perfect and only the subscribers stopped receiving
  anything. They arrive by import, over MCP and off a clipboard. Measured on a fixture of ten
  posts: eight such characters in `/feed.xml`, and the category and tag feeds carried them too.
- **A download link in a post was broken on every install.** Storing a post strips the
  `/uploads/` prefix from a store path and expanding it only ever put `media/` back, so
  a link written to `/uploads/files/report.pdf` came back as a relative address resolved against the
  post's own. A link that 404s looks like a link until somebody presses it.
- **Six print rules shipped outside their own media block**, landing after the `}` that closes
  `@media print`, so two `display:none!important` and a `border:0` applied on every screen. Valid
  CSS, every selector in use, and the existing print test satisfied.
- **A blog whose tags or series are not written in Latin or Cyrillic had no archive at all.**
  `slugify` folds those two scripts and drops everything else, and the taxonomy slug had no
  fallback, so a tag in Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi or Greek came back
  as the empty string. Every taxonomy link on every page pointed at `/tag/`, which is a 404; the
  sitemap advertised that same dead URL and collapsed every such tag into one entry; and
  `/tag/日本語` worked right up until the canonical check compared it against the empty slug and
  redirected the working address into the dead one. Three of those scripts are languages this
  admin is translated into.
- **A series in one of those scripts had no address in either spelling**, and the admin's series
  drawer had been printing `href="/series/"` from a second copy of the same arithmetic that was
  never fixed. No series was in the sitemap either, so a crawler could reach one only by
  following a link from a post inside it.
- **A visitor's comment could become permanently unsendable.** The proof-of-work stamp is spent
  when the comment is sent, and a refusal the reader can fix, a mistyped address or a body over
  the limit, returned without arming a new one. The next press sent no stamp at all, so the form
  was dead until a reload threw away what they had written. This is the path every fresh install
  takes, since Turnstile ships off.
- **Two redirects pointing at each other were accepted in silence**, and a visitor walked between
  them until the browser gave up, twelve hops. These are 301s and a browser caches a permanent
  redirect hard, so a reader who met the loop once kept meeting it after the owner had fixed the
  rule.
- **A post's summary carried its own notation into four places.** A link whose label holds a
  bracket, a footnote, a callout tag and a table all went into the deck, the meta description,
  the OG card and the RSS summary as the characters somebody typed. A post holding one four-cell
  table counted fifteen words instead of four, so its reading time was wrong on the page and in
  the panel beside the editor.
- **A table written with one hyphen per cell was read as content.** GFM's delimiter row is one or
  more hyphens, and the rule asked for two or more, so `| - | - |` left `- -` in all four
  summaries. Every table fixture in the tests happens to use three hyphens, which is what an
  editor produces and not what a person typing a small table by hand does.
- **Six shapes the Markdown engine was wrong about**, found by feeding it what the corpus does
  not hold: a bracket inside a link's label destroyed the link, a footnote whose definition is
  one token was deleted, a bare URL with an underscore inside bold went to the wrong address, two
  lists in a row became one, a footnote reference inside a pen mark flickered between saves, and
  a pen stroke re-rolled its shape.
- **An imported table lost its widest rows**, because GFM reads the column count off the header
  row and HTML gets narrow first rows honestly. And the second untitled post of a blog with no
  Latin in its titles was filed under `-2`, then `-3`, `-4`.

#### Security

- **A footnote could put a working event handler on the page.** A footnote's id is the author's
  own text and it goes into four HTML attributes, unescaped, with a charset that allowed quotes
  and slashes. `[^n"/onmouseover="alert(1)]` closed the `id="` attribute and opened one of its
  own; parsed into a DOM, the list item came back carrying a real `onmouseover`, on the reader's
  page and on the owner's preview. This is the one rendering path that does not go through the
  Markdown engine. The id is escaped rather than narrowed, because `[^ghi-chú]` is an id people
  write.
- **The second factor could be guessed at about eighty tries a second.** The rate-limit pair on
  the 2FA step is gated on the code not looking like a TOTP, so a six-digit guess was never
  counted and never charged; the only cost was five tries per ticket, and a ticket costs one
  correct password, which is what an attacker at this step already has. Measured against the real
  app from one address, sequentially: 645 guesses in 8 seconds, no 429, the account not locked
  afterwards. With the drift window three codes are live at any instant, so that is an even
  chance of being inside within the hour.
- **An address could write a header of its own, and a second SMTP command.** A recipient holding
  a CRLF emitted a real `Bcc:` header, and the same characters in an envelope address are a
  second command. Nothing reachable puts one there, so this closes no hole; it makes the rule
  true of the code that writes RFC 5322 rather than of the four callers that happen to be
  careful.
- **The OAuth consent token did not pin the scope it was minted for**, so the signature for a
  `read` consent verified against a `full` one. Only the owner's own browser can submit that form
  and the scope is printed on it, so nothing was exploitable; pinning the parameters is what the
  function's own comment promises, and the scope is one of them.
- **Two sweeps now ask the running app what it answers** rather than reading what it was told to.
  Every route is asked without a session, 212 of them today, and the answer has to be not-200 or
  a path on a list that reads like the reader's own site. A post dated an hour ahead, a draft and
  a post in the Trash are each asked for on eighteen public surfaces at once. Both carry a
  counter-test, because every assertion in them is that something is absent, and it is absent
  from a page that failed to render too.

#### Mail

- **A `From:` name in quotes went out as two mailboxes.** `"Blog, Inc"` was sent as
  `From: Blog, Inc <hi@example.com>`, which RFC 5322 reads as a list of two addresses with no
  `Sender:`, and a colon in the name made a malformed group instead. The quoted spelling is the
  correct thing for an owner to type, so this broke the input that was right.
- **Two lines went past the length a mail server allows.** A trailing space is rewritten as `=20`
  after the encoder has decided the line fits, so 74 characters and a space came out at 77 where
  RFC 2045 allows 76; and an encoded subject was sized to 76 on its own, which is 81 once the
  header name in front of it is counted.
- **The SMTP reader cut a reply where the text first appeared rather than where the match was**,
  leaving half of it in the buffer to be read as the answer to the next command.

#### The admin

- **A tab left open across a release drew the admin with no stylesheet at all.** The shell
  carries the sheet's fingerprint and the route resolved exactly one such name, this build's, so
  an older tab asked for its own and got a 404. Any fingerprinted name now answers with the
  current sheet: styles one release out of step are a nudge out of place, a 404 is a bare page.
- **The settings screen carried two Save keys for one save.** Eleven cards drew a key meant for a
  card that can try the far end, and six of them had no route and no test behind it. Three went
  further and printed a green lamp reporting a connection that does not exist.
- **Seven lamps said the far end had answered, having asked nobody.** Four of them are a switch
  with nothing behind it that could reply, and three more went green because a credential was
  stored. The colour was never the bug, the sentence was: the vocabulary now separates "switched
  on" from "saved, but not tried yet" from "not set up yet".
- **Four of eleven languages printed the Save key on top of the tabs.** The group holding the key
  and the search box could be laid out narrower than its contents, so instead of the row wrapping
  it printed over the strip to its left. Measured at 1400px across all eleven locales: German and
  Portuguese buried their last tab, French and Russian buried two each. The tour runs in one
  language, which is why 213 flows were green over a header broken in four.
- **The logo flickered on every admin page.** The server prints both spellings of every keyboard
  chord and the picking was a text swap one beat after the first paint, so every page opened
  wide enough to squeeze the wordmark out of its own box and then sprang back. Both spellings are
  in the markup now and the stylesheet decides.
- **Switching the MCP server on and saving left its address and its token manager invisible**
  until the page was reloaded. The blocks are gated on the saved setting for a measured reason,
  and the other half of that rule was never written.
- **The empty state scrolled a phone sideways**, on the two screens a phone is most likely to
  reach by accident: the empty Write sheet and the 404. Measured in a 375px window at 388 against
  375.
- **A migration could add a column that a fresh install never gets.** A fresh database records
  every step as applied without running it, precisely so a duplicate column cannot throw, so the
  column was simply missing and nothing errored. A test now reads the migrations file for every
  `alter table add column` and asks a fresh database for each: twenty and one today.
- **The activity log said WordPress whichever blog the posts came from.** One save loop serves
  four importers and logged one kind, and the detail line underneath said `ghost:`.
- **Check unused named the owner's own avatar, favicon and app icon.** The sweep only reports,
  but the owner deletes on its word. It read two fields where a blog can hold nine pictures.
- **A distribution with a quartile missing.** `group by` drops empty buckets, so a page everybody
  finishes returned three rows and the screen drew them as the whole shape: the quartile that
  mattered most, where nobody stopped, was the one not on the page.
- **Four families of activity log row had no home**, so a sign-in, a failed sign-in, a wrong
  authenticator code and a recovery code spent were filed under the heading for cache flushes,
  with the cache glyph beside them.
- **The token endpoint said it was not there** to a discovery probe the site's own markup had
  pointed at that address a moment earlier. 405 with `Allow:` says the door is here and names the
  knock.

#### The image

- **A Quire Ink container said it was Bun.** All nine OCI labels were the base image's,
  inherited and never overridden, so a published image described itself as title `bun`,
  version `1.4.2-slim`, source `github.com/oven-sh/bun`, licence NOASSERTION, and a build date
  belonging to somebody else's build. Read off the published 2.2.12 manifest, both
  architectures. That is not cosmetic for the people this image is for: a registry reads
  `image.source` to link a package to its repository, so the GHCR page pointed at Bun's, and
  Watchtower, Diun and a NAS container UI read the same labels to say what is running and
  whether it has moved. An upgrade notifier comparing versions was comparing Bun's. The eight
  fixed labels are literals in the Dockerfile, so every build shape carries them including a
  local `docker compose up --build`; `check:docs` holds the version to `package.json` as an
  eighth tracked place, and CI fails if the title, the source, the licence or the version ever
  comes back wrong.

#### The reading page

- **The scroll fade could leave a chunk of an article or a run of cards dim, and hold it there.**
  A scroll-driven animation's value is written in the frame, and where the frame is late, a long
  task or a range an engine resolved once and never resolved again, the element goes on painting
  the animation's fill. All three of them carried one. Measured by reading style after a scroll
  with no frame in between: running text came back at opacity 0.35 and three cards at opacity 0,
  which is a card with real height, real gaps around it and no words in it. The fill bought
  nothing, because both ranges end where the element stops being visible. Reported three times
  over five weeks and patched three times at the geometry end, which was never what was wrong.
- **Five keys answered a pointer and then took the click in silence**, and one press was carved
  in the heading ink over a surface made of the same ink, so it could not be seen at all. The
  rule is a ledger now: a key with a hover has a press, or is named with the reason it has none.
- **The theme key offered "dark" to a page that was already dark.** It printed the mode it would
  switch to only when the mode had been chosen by hand; under "follow the system" or "by the
  hour" it printed the setting instead. It now always names the opposite of what is on screen.
- **The book button drew a scribbled ellipse on hover**, in a vocabulary no other control on the
  page speaks. It fills with the same paper the header keys fill with.
- **A scrolling box could not be focused.** Wide tables and display formulas take their own
  horizontal scrollbar and neither was a tab stop, so what sat past the right edge was reachable
  by dragging and by nothing else. Measured at 320px on a seeded blog: four of six tables
  overflow, and seven of seven formulas.
- **Three curves were doing the floor's one job**, and the admin's default easing was the CSS
  framework's rather than the one this product chose, so speeds matched while shapes did not. The
  pen's bar and its popup simply appeared where every other surface arrives. A fourteenth static
  guard holds the rule.
- **A small key with a border was 33.5px** against a rule that allows two heights and no others.
  The box is `border-box`, so a bordered variant pays for its hairline out of the height it is
  trying to keep. Thirty-one keys, measured by reading the running admin back through a browser
  one tab at a time.

### Guards

- A tour flow presses the key rather than calling the endpoint, on the Markdown export, the bulk
  bar, the language panel and the Content API card. Three of the four found a wiring bug on their
  first run that the unit tests could not see, and issue #60 is why they exist: the Trash spent
  thirteen days with a working endpoint and no control that called it.
- A test that archived a backup was tarring the developer's own upload folder, 895 files, and had
  been going green in the morning and red by midnight with nothing in the repository changed
  between. 93 seconds and a timeout, to 739ms.
- **CI was red for four commits while the same suite was green on the machine the code was
  written on**, which is the shape worth naming rather than retrying. The theme button keeps
  the server's sun so it can put it back when the reader returns to light, and it kept it in a
  module variable, so the first such button any process drew donated its drawing to every
  button after it. One page carries one button, so the product never saw it; a test process
  carries as many as its files build, and module state is shared across files in one run. The
  runner's file order decided which fixture won, and that order differs between Linux and
  macOS. Kept per button now, and the mutation is pinned in one file and one order, because a
  bug that only appears under a particular file order is a bug nothing can be relied on to
  catch again.
- The i18n typography guard is the thirteenth; the motion drift guard is the fourteenth.

### What 2.2.13 does not do

- **ActivityPub publishes; it does not read.** Replies, likes and boosts are dropped. Following
  other accounts, a reply becoming a comment, and boosts are not here.
- **The Content API is read only, and it has no key.** It is all or nothing, gated by one switch:
  there is no per-client token and no private field behind it.
- **A piece names its language; the site does not follow it.** There is no per-language route,
  listing, feed, sitemap or front page, and a piece can only name one of the eleven languages the
  interface speaks.
- **The Markdown bundle is an export, not a sync.** It is a download, and importing one back is a
  separate press.
- **A link card is fetched once and never refreshed**, so a title that changes on the far end
  stays as it was read.

## 2026-09-19 · Quire Ink 2.2.12

The AI assistant had been refusing every prompt on Google Gemini since 2.2.10, and the default
Gemini model had been shut down by Google since June. Both are fixed. Two admin screens that
drew their whole table now draw a page of it.

### New feature

- **The library turns pages.** 200 pictures a tab, a pager under the grid, and the page in the
  address so it can be linked and the Back key works. Videos and files page by the same measure.
  The count and the size above the grid stay the whole library rather than the page, so the
  figure does not move as you turn. The pager link carries its own kind, because switching tabs
  on that screen is an attribute rather than a navigation and the address can be sitting on
  another one.
- **The write column draws a hundred rows, then more as you scroll.** Everything stays IN the
  page, which is what lets the search, both filter rows and the sort go on being node moves over
  what is already there: the search box still reaches a piece six hundred rows down. Driven with
  226 pieces, it showed 100, then 200, then 226, and found "Bulk post number 170" from the box.

### Fixed

- **Gemini refused every assistant prompt on 2.2.11, and nothing in this repository had
  changed.** `update_settings.value` is `string | number | boolean`. zod 4.4.3 wrote that as an
  `anyOf` of one-type schemas and zod 4.6.0, which arrived with 2.2.10, writes it as
  `type: ["string","number","boolean"]`. Both are the same schema by the spec; Google's `type`
  is a single-valued enum, so it refused the whole request with a 400 before reading a word of
  it. The admin could only report that as "the model did not respond, check the key", on a key
  that was correct. Found by building the outgoing request on both tags with each tag's own
  lockfile and diffing: 49 function declarations against 42, identical apart from the seven new
  note tools and that one field. A guard now walks the real registry through the real
  conversion and refuses anything outside Gemini's own Schema, by field name as well as by
  shape, because what escaped was a field nobody here wrote.
- **The default Gemini model had been shut down by Google on 1 June 2026.** `gemini-2.0-flash`
  was the fallback whenever the owner had not picked a model by hand, which is the normal path:
  the model menu is empty until Load models is pressed. Every Gemini blog in that state lost all
  four AI jobs at once, and three of them failed in silence, because alt text, excerpts and the
  comment guard treat every kind of no as "quietly do nothing". Now `gemini-2.5-flash`, and
  deliberately not 3.x, whose tool calls must echo a thought signature nothing here carries yet.
  DeepSeek's retired `deepseek-v4-flash` moves to `deepseek-flash` for the same reason.
- **A path with two leading slashes came back as a redirect off the site.** The middleware that
  strips a trailing slash answers every request; handed `//evil.example/` it replied
  `Location: //evil.example`, which a browser reads as another origin. So a link wearing the
  blog's own domain landed somewhere else. An ordinary client collapses the pair before it is
  sent, which is why nothing had seen it; `curl --path-as-is` shows it, and a proxy that merges
  slashes hides it, but the one-command Caddy layout this project ships does not.
- **A conversation past the eighth question broke, and stayed broken.** The screen sent the last
  30 turns, counted; a round that calls a tool is four turns long, so the window regularly opened
  on a tool result whose call had just been cut away, which Anthropic and OpenAI both refuse. The
  server stores what the screen sent, so the next question re-cut at the same place and reopening
  the conversation loaded the damage back. The window now opens where a question begins.
- **Pressing Allow could run an approved tool twice.** The consent loop executed each approved
  call as it walked the turns and threw the results away the moment it met one the owner had not
  answered for, leaving those calls unanswered on screen; the next Allow ran them again. Delete
  survives that, uploading a picture and sending a test newsletter do not. Nothing runs now until
  every call has an answer, and the pause names all of them rather than the first.
- **The clip page was offered to shared caches.** `/notes/clip` is the owner's, and the header
  rule decides by path, so a CDN was invited to hold the owner's rendered page for a minute and
  serve it to anybody, including the variant that links a note which defaults to draft.
- **Micropub refused the strongest token there is.** `admin` is `full` plus the guarded settings,
  not a different kind of grant, so an admin token was turned away as read-only.
- **The restore check was not counting the notebook.** `notes` and `webmentions` arrived with
  2.2.10 and were never added to the list of tables it compares, so a restored archive could have
  lost every note the owner wrote and the check would still have passed.
- **Alt text and excerpts stopped silently on a thinking Anthropic model.** The answer was read
  off the first content block, and a model that thinks puts a thinking block in front of it.
- **Gemini's thinking tokens never reached the cost meter**, which reported roughly half on a
  thinking model, on the one screen that promises to say what a conversation costs.
- **Switching AI provider stored the previous provider's model.** The model menu ships disabled
  holding the stored id and the card reads its payload off the page, so the next job asked Google
  for `gpt-4o-mini`, and the card said the far end had answered.
- **"Save and test" on the off-server backup tested nothing**, on every install that already had
  a bucket: the test is skipped unless the bucket field has been typed into, and a stored
  credential ships as an empty box because blank means keep. A rotated secret was reported as
  verified and would have been discovered at the one moment it matters.
- **A card holding a key could not go amber.** The rule is that unsaved edits outrank a working
  connection, and the repaint only compared settings controls: credential boxes carry none, so
  Cloudflare, the off-server copy, SMTP and the comment keys stayed green through any typing.
- **"How readers sign in" went nowhere.** Drawn beside the comments switch since the admin was
  converted, read by nothing.
- **The wordmark sat 2.11px above the axis of the search key beside it**, because the box it is
  centred in carries the descender of the `q` and the letters do not. Shut, the rail's `Q.` lost
  2.58px of its red full stop to the wrapper that truncates the word in the open rail.
- **`get_post_traffic` carried visitors' words unmarked.** It is the traffic tool narrowed to one
  page and returns the same referrer list, written through an open endpoint, so whether the
  assistant paused before a write depended on which of the two the model reached for.
- **There are two copies of zod in the tree, and now there is one.** The MCP door serialises tool
  schemas with the SDK's own bundled copy, which the lockfile had left a version behind, so the
  two doors onto one tool registry disagreed about that same field. The safe spelling was an
  accident of resolution; it is a written line now, and a test holds the two doors to each other.

## 2026-09-16 · Quire Ink 2.2.11

No new feature in this one. It is the repair release for 2.2.10, cut the same day, and every
number below was read off a rendered page in a browser rather than off the classes.

### Fixed

- **The spare menu button, on every blog still on the default column width.** 2.2.10 moved
  the rail's geometry out of the page and into the cached stylesheet, which saves 1,046
  compressed bytes on every view. It also moved the rule that puts the drawer button away
  above the breakpoint: `.rail-toggle{display:none}` landed 130 rules ahead of
  `.icon-btn{display:flex}` in the same sheet, one class each, so source order decided it and
  the button stayed. Measured at 1440px: a drawer button drawn next to a rail that was already
  standing in the left gutter, opening a copy of what was on the screen. The source-code look
  prints a word beside every control, so on that look it read `[menu]`. The same move had also
  cost the gutter rail its padding, 20px where it should have been 0. A blog whose owner had
  moved the reading column never saw either: that one still gets its own geometry inline,
  after the sheet. The geometry now sits second to last in the sheet, ahead of PRINT alone,
  and a test holds it against the rule it has to outrank rather than against a line number.
- **Page two of a category or a tag named page one as its canonical**, and wore page one's
  title. A canonical pointing at page one asks a search engine to fold the deeper pages away
  and take with them every post that appears nowhere else, which on a blog with two hundred
  posts in one category is most of the category. The home pager had done both correctly since
  the word for "page" moved into the locale table; the archives were never brought along.
  Series is untouched: it is read front to back and is never paginated.
- **A listing's rail stood at the foot of the page between 960px and 1272px**, with the button
  that opens it hidden by the same rule. That range is an iPad on its side and a 13 inch
  laptop. Measured at 1180px: the rail began at y=2729 on a 3601px page, so the menu, the
  categories, the series and the tags could not be reached without scrolling past every post.
  The band that lays a rail out in flow is the article's, whose rail is written under the
  title; a listing writes its rail last inside `<main>` so the heading leads the document, and
  it now keeps the drawer it uses on a phone right up to the width where the rail moves into
  the gutter.

### A few improvements

- **A new install types quietly.** The key sound starts at 10 rather than 60, on a scale
  rebuilt in August to be much louder than the one before it: a letter at 60 measures about
  four times the amplitude of the old scale's maximum. Only the default moves, so a blog that
  has already chosen a volume keeps it.
- **The notebook look's quiet ink meets the desk it sits on.** That look darkens the page to
  make the desk under the sheet, and the palette's `--c-meta` was measured against the page,
  so the tagline, the pager count, the footer and the dates down the rail came out at 4.47:1
  where AA asks 4.5 at that size, on all six palettes. 4.60:1 now, and dark was never short.
- **The unchosen label on a segmented control answers to two numbers**, and had only ever
  satisfied one: 4.5:1 against the neutral-200 groove it sits in, and 3:1 against the
  near-black label on the chosen key. The two Tailwind steps either side give 3.76 and 4.2, or
  6.2 and 2.53. The value in between reads 4.63 and 3.40.
- **Four edges on the settings screens line up.** The tab row padded by 16 and the panel under
  it by 20, so the strip began at x=273 while the cards began at 277, and the search field
  ended at 1375 against the grid's 1371. A state lamp beside a card title moved that title,
  and only some cards have a state to report, so one title stood 18px in from every other; the
  lamp rides at the end of the header row now. Two stacks stepped 16 where the other 55 step
  20, and one ruled division was 16/16 where the other nine are 24 above and 20 below.


## 2026-09-16 — Quire Ink 2.2.10

The five pre-releases from 2026-09-09 to 2026-09-16, in one release. `latest`, `2.2` and
`2.2.10` all point at it. 186 commits since 2.2.9.

Two things carried this release. The first is subtraction: **twenty-two declared packages
left and twelve arrived**, among them React and its DOM renderer, the seven `@tiptap/*`
packages wrapping the editor, `marked`, and the Tailwind CLI. Declared dependencies went from
32 to 22, the lockfile from 360 resolved packages to 221, and a clean install from 194 MB on
disk to 138 MB. What replaced them is code in this repository that the tests own. The second
is the pen: the marks the author writes are now marks a reader can write too, kept without an
account, and the same hand draws both.

### The admin is pages again (ADR 0054)

It was a React application that arrived as an empty page and then asked the server what to
put in it. It is server-rendered HTML now, with behaviour added as small islands of
hand-written JavaScript.

- **A screen arrives finished.** Time to the heading being on screen, old build and new
  running side by side on one seeded database at 500 KB/s: activity log 1,038ms to 285ms,
  help 1,019ms to 296ms, trash 953ms to 293ms, comments 957ms to 326ms, dashboard 940ms to
  336ms. What the browser must have before the first frame went from 297 KB to 22 KB.
- **Over the wire, cold cache, same seeded blog:** opening the admin is 14 requests carrying
  14.8 KB of JavaScript, where it was 30 requests and 141.3 KB. The write list is 17 requests
  and 19.8 KB, where it was 29 and 135.3. The editor page is 27 requests and 220.1 KB, where
  it was 35 and 401.2.
- **191 `.tsx` files and 25,713 lines of them are gone**, and there is no `.tsx` file left in
  the tree.
- **The admin stopped flashing light before going dark.** Its boot script was inline, and an
  nginx install sends `script-src 'self'`, so on three of the four public instances it had
  never run: 189 to 246ms of light admin on a throttled connection, the rail at the wrong
  width on every load, and Ctrl printed to people on a Mac. It is a fingerprinted file now,
  which `'self'` allows with nothing for an operator to configure.
- **The cost, stated:** a row click is a real navigation, so nothing survives it. Opening a
  post you had already opened was 12ms and is 107ms. Opening the first one went 346ms to
  107ms.
- **Settings is one page with all seven tabs drawn**: 244 controls, 22 cards, 112 search
  rows. The tab is in the address on Settings, Trash, Newsletter and Media, and the
  conversation is in the address on the assistant.

### The editor stands on ProseMirror directly

- **The wrapper left.** Nine `@tiptap/*` packages out, twelve `prosemirror-*` in. Ready to
  type went from 394, 396 and 402ms to 106, 107 and 108ms; the editor's JavaScript from
  1,028 KB to 524 KB, 325 to 167 compressed; plugins mounted per editor from 102 to 15.
- **45 corpus fixtures produce byte-identical Markdown through both editors**, and the schema
  was compared against a running Tiptap editor across 310 assertions before the removal. That
  was the condition for doing it at all.
- **Find and replace, in both views.** `Mod-f` raises a strip under the action line, and
  `Mod-Shift-f` raises it with replace open. One view is a document whose hits are positions
  and the other a text box holding a string, and nobody should have to notice which they are
  in before pressing a key. Nothing enters the document, so looking through a piece is not an
  edit and there is nothing to undo.
- **The editor stopped working between sentences.** Every edit armed a 400ms timer that
  serialized the whole document, which is shorter than the pause a writer takes between two
  sentences: 126ms of frozen editor, five times in six seconds of ordinary typing, and
  nothing read what it produced. A save on an 18,000 word draft carrying 2,159 marks went
  from 144ms to 7ms.

### One Markdown engine of our own (ADR 0052)

- **`marked`, `markdown-it`, `tiptap-markdown` and `prosemirror-markdown` are out.** One
  engine in `src/md` renders the reader's page, opens a post in the editor, saves it back,
  cuts the excerpt and writes the plain text a search index reads, all from one parse.
- **Measured against the specifications rather than against itself**: CommonMark 0.31.2 at
  648 of 652 examples and GFM at 24 of 24, on every run. The four it does not pass are shapes
  this blog disagrees with on purpose, each named in the suite.
- **The two engines were compared on 92 real posts before the switch**, three ways: byte
  equality, a ladder of rewrites that are provably invisible, and a DOM walk comparing the
  trees node by node. The comparison found a hole nobody had noticed: a `javascript:`
  destination published as a working link.
- **The engine has no dependencies.** Its own suites pass with `node_modules` deleted, and
  `md/boundary.test.ts` holds it to one import from the rest of the tree.
- **A hostile paste can no longer stall the process.** Three shapes were quadratic or worse:
  4,000 unclosed link brackets went from 215ms to 2.2ms, a paragraph of 2,000 deepening
  indents from 11,817ms to 69ms, and a run of 20,000 backslashes from 1,767ms to 1.7ms.

### The reader gets a pen

- **Select words on a post and a bar offers the five inks, the underline, the ring, a note
  and the quote** (ADR 0043). On by default, with one switch under Settings, Posts. A mark is
  anchored to its words and never to a position: the exact words and thirty-two characters
  either side, the W3C text-quote shape, so a typo fixed three paragraphs up moves nothing,
  and a sentence that is gone makes the mark fail to land rather than land on the wrong words.
- **Tier one asks nothing.** Marks live in the browser's own storage under the page's path.
  Nothing is sent, and the owner cannot see them.
- **Tier two: the marks travel by a code, not an account** (ADR 0047). Google sign-in for
  commenters who already have it, or a notebook code in five groups of four for anyone who
  will not. The server keeps a hash of the code, or a keyed hash of the signed-in address,
  never the address itself, and one row per page. Five hundred pages a reader, 128 KB a page,
  kept a year past the last touch, forgotten everywhere in one click.
- **The pen inks unevenly** (ADR 0042). Fibre grain as an alpha mask, edge tremor, and
  wet-to-dry along the stroke in a dealt direction, with a faint ghost under it because paper
  soaks. The deck is eighty variants: forty for phrases over about twenty-eight characters,
  forty for a word or two, and the short ones tilt harder, overshoot further and dry faster.
- **The writer is dealt the same forty pens the reader is.** Every stroke in the editor used
  to come out of one fallback; 38 of 38 now match the published page on the document it was
  measured on. The stroke under the cursor keeps the pen it was dealt, because the variant is
  a hash of the words and re-dealing on every keystroke would change the grip under the hands.
- **A mark just applied draws itself, once** (ADR 0049): 200ms for the highlighter, 160 for
  the underline, 240 for the ring. Nothing enters the document, an existing mark never
  replays, and the words never move. A felt tip squeaks, rendered as arithmetic like the key
  click with no audio file, one switch, on by default.
- **`/pen.css` is a stylesheet anyone may link** (ADR 0048). One `<link>` and a `pen` class on
  any element on any site, and `==text==`, `++text++` and `@@word@@` draw with this blog's
  own inks, light and dark. About 35 KB gzipped, CORS open. This is a public promise, so a
  change to it gets a line here.

### The notebook, and the standards it speaks

- **A note is a third kind of writing** (ADR 0044): its own table, its own list at `/notes`,
  its own namespace, so a note called `about` and a page called `about` can both exist. Never
  in the post feed, the front page, the archive or the newsletter; in the sitemap and in
  `llms.txt` under its own heading.
- **A clip is a note with three more fields**: where the passage came from, that page's
  title, and the passage itself, as columns rather than lines of Markdown.
- **The notebook opens a door** (ADR 0045). `/notes/clip` is a page the owner keeps from,
  with no script. A reader's pen gains *Send to my notebook*, and a bookmarklet makes any
  page on the web a source.
- **IndieAuth, Micropub and Webmention** (ADR 0046). The site is an IndieAuth provider on the
  MCP server's existing OAuth door, `/micropub` accepts a note from any Micropub client, and
  `/webmention` receives mentions and verifies the source really links here.
- **Agents get the same verbs**: `list_notes` `get_note` `create_note` `update_note`
  `delete_note` `restore_note`, and `list_mentions`.

### Looks like: four dialects, one setting

- **Appearance, Looks like, and the published site wears one of four**: Plain paper, Source
  code, Newspaper or Notebook. Only the published site; the admin never changes. It is the
  last question setup asks, because it is the one thing you know before writing a word.
- **Newspaper is the one that touches your words.** It numbers sections, figures and tables,
  prints the section over the headline and the date and byline under it. The numbers live on
  the page and nowhere else: not in the feed, the newsletter, a search result, or what a
  reader copies.
- **Notebook draws the page as a sheet lying on a desk**, ruled at the leading your own type
  settings use, per paragraph rather than as one background, because a picture is not a whole
  number of lines tall and the lines would drift into the text.
- **Each look is its own stylesheet, linked only by a blog wearing it.** Plain links none.
  The rules used to ride inside `site.css`, where every blog paid 5.2 KB for something off by
  default.
- **A look contains no colour.** Two of them declared their own for two releases, and what it
  cost was the palette menu: on those looks, choosing Mono, Sepia or Forest changed not one
  pixel, because a look's selector outranks a palette's and nothing said so. Four of six rows
  were dead controls. A test now fails on a single hex anywhere in a look's stylesheet.
- **The six palettes become one set.** Every colour is solved for a contrast against its own
  paper, so the six differ in hue and in nothing else. Body text ran 10.22:1 on Sepia against
  14.75:1 on Mono; it is 12.88 to 13.08 across all six now, and headings 16.92 to 17.10. Hue
  and chroma are untouched, only lightness moved. Ocean and Sci-Fi had become the same
  palette and are two again. **No existing blog moves:** every blog stores its own copy at
  install and that copy is read first.

### Twenty-two packages out, twelve in

- **Out:** `react` and `react-dom`, seven `@tiptap/*` packages and `tiptap-markdown`,
  `marked`, `turndown` with its GFM plugin, `nodemailer`, `fflate`, `qrcode-generator`,
  `fast-xml-parser`, the Tailwind CLI, and five `@types/*` that went with them. **In:** twelve
  `prosemirror-*` packages, which is the editor standing on the library the wrapper wrapped.
  Declared dependencies went from 32 to 22, the lockfile from 360 resolved packages to 221,
  and a clean install from 194 MB on disk to 138 MB.
- **Each was proved against what it replaced.** The QR encoder payload by payload, every
  length from 1 to 2331 bytes, 2331 of 2331 identical. The utility stylesheet block by block,
  186 of 188 byte-identical, and the two that differ were a fault in the generated one. The
  importer on the golden corpus: of 45 fixtures 27 agreed, 15 came back right here and wrong
  there, and none the other way round.
- **Imports carry more of the original.** `<mark>` arrives as a highlight and `<u>` as an
  underline instead of arriving flat, a lazy-loaded image is collected instead of a grey
  placeholder, and a ZIP written on Windows no longer turns Vietnamese filenames into
  mojibake.

### What a reader downloads, measured again

A default install on the demo fixture, which is what `bun run tour` seeds, so anyone with the
repository can take these numbers again. Compressed body bytes from the origin, cold cache,
the blog's own pictures counted separately because they are content rather than software.

| | 2.2.9 | 2.2.10 |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Home, everything but pictures | 128 KB | **118.9 KB** |
| A post, everything but pictures | 131 KB | **122.8 KB** |
| A post, book mode and the reader's pen switched off | 122 KB | **114.9 KB** |
| JavaScript on a post | 15.8 KB | 15.9 KB |
| Fonts on a post | 73 KB | **65.3 KB** |
| Third-party requests | 0 | 0 |
| A page already read, second visit | 0 bytes | 0 bytes |

The font row is the release's own doing and the rest follows it: a default install preloaded
73,812 bytes of typeface, and the rule that decided which faces to preload had been written
when the default chrome face was a monospace with no metric-matched twin. The default became
Inter and the rule did not move with it. It is a property of the face now, and the figure is
40,556 bytes.

### A few improvements

- **A search means the accents that were typed.** The index folds diacritics so that
  "lap trinh" finds "lập trình", and the query was folded with it, so a search for "lề" came
  back with every "lệ", "lê" and "lẻ" on the blog. In Vietnamese those are four words.
  Measured on a live blog: "lề" went from 50 results to 10, "lê" from 50 to 6, and an
  unaccented "le" still finds all of them. No second index and nothing to reindex.
- **The passage under a hit quotes the sentence that answered the search**, opening where the
  query's words sit closest together rather than on the first one of them. SQLite's
  `snippet()` is no longer asked for it, which took 23ms per 60 rows off the owner's search.
- **Code blocks answer to 346 languages instead of 21**, loaded on demand so a blog that
  writes only Python ships only Python. A named fence is no longer reinterpreted: Ruby was
  being published coloured as Python.
- **The licence opens by itself if this project stops** (ADR 0050). `LICENSE-EXCEPTION` 1.2
  grants, today, a licence that takes effect on its own the day after 48 months pass with no
  release. It is a present grant and not a promise, because a promise needs somebody left to
  keep it.
- **An upgrade says what it brought**: a panel in the admin, once, naming the version you are
  now on with a link to its release notes. It asks the server nothing and compares two
  strings it already has.
- **Setup asks the language on the first screen.** It was the third screen's first field, so
  somebody who does not read English met the claim form and a whole authenticator screen
  before reaching it.
- **`SMTP_OFF`.** One line in `.env` and the process sends nothing. Any value other than `0`,
  `false`, `no` or empty means off, so a typo stops the mail rather than sending it, and the
  subscribe form comes off the reader's page with it.
- **The publish date can be typed.** Reaching next March took nine clicks and correcting a
  year took twelve. The day and month order comes from the admin's language rather than the
  machine's, and the 31st of February is refused rather than moved.
- **Book mode hyphenates whether or not it justifies**, sets its columns on one baseline grid,
  and turns the page instead of blinking. A new blog opens like a quire: first-line indent
  and a justified column, only for a blog that has never answered the question.
- **The rendered-page cache stopped riding along in every archive.** On the author's blog the
  database was 538 MB, of which `render_cache` was 530.3 MB: 98.5% of every backup was a file
  the app rebuilds from the Markdown beside it. The download streams to disk, which is what
  made a 262 MB archive impossible to take away.
- **Analytics counts the rows it means.** Read depth and dwell are measured on posts and
  pages rather than on the lists; a row written before the device columns existed is left out
  of the facets instead of leading every one of them; a leave sample follows the reader back
  to the tab; the owner's exclusion expires with the day rather than with the session.
- **Three index changes on the analytics database**, each measured on a synthetic table built
  from the schema: the returning-reader count 98.77ms to 4.85ms, the scroll merge on the
  write path 1.83ms to 0.00ms, and the device facet 48.30ms to 6.00ms by REMOVING the only
  index that column had.
- **Setting a timezone stopped making the home page render 4.3 times slower.** Every printed
  date built an `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to test whether the zone name was valid, threw it away,
  then built another. `formatDate` went from 76.7 microseconds to 0.68, and 800 printings
  across ten languages, eight zones and five dates come back byte for byte.
- **Nine names no post can take**: `admin` `login` `micropub` `notes` `og` `search` `setup`
  `uploads` `webmention`, each proved shadowed by a route.

### Fixed

- **One body, two reading times.** The published page said 14 minutes and the writing sheet
  said 13, because the editor carried its own word counter at 220 words a minute against the
  page's 200. Fixing it found a second fault underneath: the plain-text pass stripped a `*`
  bullet and not a `-` one, so a list written with hyphens counted one word per bullet, in the
  excerpt, the meta description, the OG card and the RSS summary as well as the count.
- **A save that did not mention the font deleted the font**, so changing the blog's title on
  one tab erased an uploaded typeface. Editing one field of one menu row wiped the whole
  menu, and the same shape cost the featured list every slug before the one touched.
- **Three credential cards said a key was saved and had sent nothing.** Cloudflare, off-site
  storage and the model provider each posted an empty object, read `ok: true` off it and
  turned the lamp green.
- **Twenty behaviours in all**, the three cards above among them, were drawn and wired to
  nothing, found by comparing every `data-*` hook the admin draws against every hook an island
  reads: minting, copying and revoking an MCP token, all four importers, adding a redirect,
  clearing the cache, editing the header menu, the featured list, the front page rows and the
  footer marks, uploading a custom font, and the off-site storage test.
- **Four buttons answered a refusal with silence or with the wrong screen.** Ending the device
  you are signed in on sent you to the sign-in page whether or not it worked; undo after
  trashing a piece reloaded the page on any answer, and the reload takes the toast holding the
  undo with it; the same for undo on several pieces; undo after deleting a comment said
  nothing at all.
- **Deleting a backup archive asked nothing.** It unlinked the file and said "Moved to Trash",
  and there is no trash for a backup.
- **Eleven keystroke faults in the writing surface**, found by driving the old build character
  by character: a typed URL corrupted by one character, a checklist converting the whole list,
  a rule or a formula leaving the node selected so the next character replaced it, Tab in the
  last table cell leaving the editor, a cleared nested bullet reopening as a heading. The
  editor could also save Markdown it could not reopen.
- **A picture comes out of the paragraph Markdown wrote it in.** Markdown has one shape for a
  picture and it is inline, so a picture on its own line was a block node inside a paragraph:
  46 pixels of empty line under every picture in the editor, and a `<figure>` inside a `<p>`
  on the reader's page, 43 times across 20 posts.
- **The Markdown view left an empty sheet on the way back**, with the document intact in an
  editor nobody could see. That had been on production for three commits.
- **Dates printed in the machine's language, not the admin's.** A Vietnamese admin read
  "Sep 14, 2026, 7:59 AM" one line above "14 thg 9, 2026, 07:59", and a post scheduled for
  02:30 from New York printed back as 03:30.
- **An emptied number field sent zero**, setting posts per page to none and the upload limit
  to zero bytes; a value under a field's floor was rewritten in silence while the screen said
  "Settings saved"; and the palette switch failed towards on, turning palettes back on that
  the owner had switched off.
- **The MCP card handed out a URL and a token for a switch nobody had saved**, so the working
  order ended at a client reading "server is currently unavailable" from an endpoint that was
  still off.
- **The three questions after the account were being skipped on every real install**, because
  where a first-run owner landed was decided by whether a site address was known, and every
  deployment path this project ships sets one.
- **`/page/1` answered a 301 with no `Cache-Control` and no security headers**, because the
  redirect was registered above the middleware that adds them. A 301 with no freshness is held
  hard by browsers, and this one's destination is a setting.
- **Filtering the activity log to nothing showed a blank panel**, and a settings field's named
  refusal never became visible: both islands looked for markup no screen has ever drawn.
- **`getPage` and `getNote` selected the autosave blob into the public render path.**
- **The write list is a list again.** A summary carried a clamp beside a display utility that
  wins the cascade, so rows ran from 44px to 199px and five of forty-nine pieces fitted on a
  900px screen. Ten fit now.
- **The last seven `:has()` rules left the admin.** On another site that selector took a page
  from 0.75s to 4.19s and crashed WebKit's render process.
- **Six holes found in a security review of the public surface**, every one reachable without
  credentials. A kept passage decodes entities once and strips tags to a fixed point, where
  `&amp;lt;` used to come back as a `<`.
- **The contents stand under the title on a tablet.** The rail had a gutter above 1272px and a
  drawer below 60rem, and an iPad on its side at 1024 fell in the hole between them: no index,
  and a menu button opening a drawer over the article.
- **A caption belongs to its picture**, the pen's underline clears the feet of the letters, a
  sub-heading's number in the contents index fits, the formatting strip comes back after
  scrolling, and the header's name speaks the same dialect as the chrome around it.
- 53 strings nobody could reach are out of all eleven languages.

### Guards

- **Twelve static guards in `check:all`**, three of them new this release: `check:deps` (a
  dependency is a decision), `check:admin-css` (the admin's stylesheet against the markup that
  uses it) and `check:admin-wired` (every `data-*` the admin draws against every one an island
  reads, in both directions: running it the other way found two shipped faults).
- **3,669 tests and 211 browser tour flows** on the release commit, plus a restore check that
  opens the archive the tour built: `integrity_check` on both databases, no table with fewer
  rows than before the snapshot, every upload byte-identical.
- The code scanning dashboard is at zero, one alert fixed and three recorded as examined with
  the reason on each.

### What 2.2.10 does not do

- **There is no multi-user mode.** One blog, one owner, one process. Comments have accounts
  where the writing side does not.
- **A NAS and a Kubernetes cluster get no Caddy**, and that is deliberate: a NAS already holds
  ports 80 and 443 behind its own certificate UI, and a cluster terminates TLS at its ingress.
- **Two devices marking the same page at once overwrite each other**, last save wins
  (ADR 0047). **Nothing in the admin shows which passages readers keep most**; only the
  `list_mentions` MCP tool answers that, and readers are not shown it either.
- **Webmention verifies its source and rate-limits, but has no spam judgement**: the comment
  gate is not wired to it.
- **Typing straight after a link puts the characters inside it**, found and left alone on
  purpose, pinned by a test so it cannot drift without somebody deciding.
- **There are four looks and no fifth**, a look is site-wide and dresses the published site
  only, and going further is still custom CSS.
- **The STARTTLS upgrade is proved against a real relay at deploy time and nowhere else**,
  since Bun cannot turn an open socket into a TLS one on the server side.
- **The Help screens are still English only**, a few counts still read "1 words", and 26
  `Etc/GMT` timezones left the list.
- **The Motion switch is the owner's rather than per-reader**; an install that rewrites its
  own HTML with nginx `sub_filter` loses the origin's compression and validator; and an origin
  with no CDN makes a reader on the far side of the planet pay a round trip that saved bytes
  cannot buy back.

## 2026-09-07 — Quire Ink 2.2.9

Two audits and everything they turned up in a day and a half, eighty-nine commits of it. One
audit went over the admin screen by screen, the other over the reading site and the code
beneath it. Settings are regrouped around the question the owner is holding rather than the
part of the code a key belongs to; the browser's own dialogs are gone; every layout shift
measured on arrival is zero; the admin's first frame is 375 KB where it was 1,063; and a
dozen ways of losing work are closed, from two tabs saving settings at once to an editor that
reopened the piece it had just saved. It also carries the fix 2.2.8 needed.

### The admin loaded React twice

- **A blank screen after sign-in, with `Minified React error #321` in the console**
  ([#65](https://github.com/joiha-steven/quireink/issues/65)). The entry script is written to
  disk as `main.js` and was served under a name the server computed, `main.<hash>.js`, so the
  owner would not re-download it on every load. That held only while no code-split chunk
  imported the entry back. Bun 1.4 — the version the release image picked up — imports it back
  from **every** lazy route chunk, where 1.3 imported it from none. A JavaScript module is
  identified by the URL it was fetched from, so the browser held the entry twice: two module
  records, two copies of React, and the first lazy screen to call a hook resolved a dispatcher
  belonging to the other copy. The dashboard is that screen, which is why the admin was blank
  from the moment it opened.
- **The entry now carries the bundler's own hash and nothing renames it** —
  `admin.<hash>.js`, a dot to keep it apart from the `main-<hash>.js` chunks. The name the
  shell loads and the name a chunk imports are one string, so there is one module however the
  bundler splits the graph next. The stylesheet keeps its computed fingerprint: Tailwind
  writes that file, and nothing imports a stylesheet by name.
- **Two guards for the property, not the symptom.** `check:admin-bundle` reads the built
  directory for exactly one entry and no import naming a file that is not there, and a test
  walks every URL the admin shell can reach and fails if two of them serve the same bytes.
- **Nothing a reader sees was affected.** Public pages arrive as finished HTML and were never
  blank; this was the admin's bundle alone.

### Settings, regrouped by the question you are holding

- **Seven tabs, each printing its question under its name** ([ADR 0041](./docs/decisions/0041-settings-by-the-owners-question.md)).
  The eight tabs before them were grouped by which part of the CODE a key belonged to.
  Measured at 1440px: Appearance held 137 controls over 2,825px while five other tabs sat
  within 31px of 1,236 — 36% of every control on the screen behind one word — and the answer
  to "how do readers sign in to comment" lived three tabs from "should there be comments".
  It is Blog · Home & menu · Posts · Appearance · Comments & mail · Server & connections ·
  Account now, 21 · 39 · 62 · 95 · 17 · 40 · 19 controls. Every old `?tab=` address lands on
  the tab that now holds those keys, and `?setting=<key>` still jumps to the card.
- **The Save key names the work waiting on it** — "Save · 3 change(s)", disabled at zero,
  counted by comparing the form against the settings the server last sent. It is on all seven
  tabs. It began on four, because the other three are made of cards that save themselves; a
  control that stands in the place the eye goes on four screens and is missing on three reads
  as a fault, whatever sentence is put in its place. The cards keep their own key, because
  storing a mail host and TESTING it are not one act.
- **The backup card held three settings and no way to save them** — automatic backups on or
  off, how often, how many to keep. It was filed with the cards made of actions (run a
  snapshot, download the archive), so changing the schedule marked the form dirty and stored
  nothing from that tab.
- **Leaving with unsaved changes asks a three-way question** in the product's own dialog: save
  and go, discard, stay. Back and Forward go through it too — a same-document history move
  fires no `beforeunload`, so the browser's own buttons threw an edited form away in silence.
- **A refused field points at the field.** A list path a post already holds used to arrive as
  "Save failed" in a corner toast on a screen of forty controls; the tab opens and the field
  says what is wrong.
- **The language applies when it is stored, not when it is picked.** Trying one out handed
  somebody an admin in it, an unsaved form and a Save key to find in a language they had not
  chosen; leaving put it back without a word, which reads as the setting having failed.

### The browser's twenty dialogs come out

- **Sixteen `confirm()` and four `prompt()` in the admin, now none**, and `check:admin-kit`
  fails the next one. The browser draws those boxes, so the question deciding whether a post
  is destroyed forever wore none of this product's grammar; `confirm()` takes one string, so
  "Permanently delete this item?" was the whole question and WHICH item was left to whichever
  row the pointer was over; and they freeze the page behind them for as long as somebody
  thinks about it. The replacement splits by whether the act can be walked back.
- **A toast waits to be read and can be sent away.** It also reaches a screen reader now:
  the live regions are in the document before the message lands, which is the only order in
  which they are announced.
- **One shape for waiting, one for empty, and a failure that can be asked again.** Three
  spellings of "loading" and two of "nothing here" became one each, and three screens that
  swallowed a failed fetch — subscribers, redirects, the media grid — say so and offer the
  retry. The shell itself does: a 500 from its one view used to leave an empty grey page.
- **Every empty screen offers the thing you came to do.** Trash, the assistant, the write
  sheet and the 404 were 2,000px of white paper with a bare heading.

### Nothing that could lose work

- **The editor's snapshot follows the piece, not the screen.** The local key is
  `quire:draft:post:new` until a post has a row, and it was fixed at the value it had when
  the editor mounted: everything typed after a new post's FIRST save went on being written
  under `new`, invisible to the editor that reopens that post, and reopened by the next blank
  sheet as a piece of its own.
- **New post after a save gives a blank sheet.** The editor moves the address itself when a
  new piece is first saved — a raw history call, because routing there would remount the
  editor and take the caret and the undo stack with it — so the router still held
  `/admin/editor` and the next click on New post pushed the path it believed it was already
  on. Nothing remounted, the blank sheet came up holding the saved piece, and the next article
  typed into it overwrote the first. The router counts address moves and the route is keyed on
  that count as well as the path.
- **An unsaved draft is reopened into the editor** rather than offered back to it. A writer
  who typed, left without pressing Save and came back met an empty page with a one-line offer
  above it; the text was in storage the whole time.
- **Two settings saves at once stop erasing each other.** Two tabs, or a card and the sheet,
  each PUT the whole record they had read; the writes are queued so the second runs on the
  result of the first.
- **A mistyped setting cannot break the site**, at either end: the write path refuses a value
  of the wrong type and the read path clamps what it finds. A settings blob that will not
  parse is kept beside the database before anything overwrites it — one corrupt byte used to
  mean a silent reset to defaults.
- **A rename and a purge either finish or never happened.** Both wrote several tables outside
  a transaction, so a failure halfway left a post under one name in one table and another in
  the next.
- **A restored post takes its path back**, a redirect can no longer be saved over live
  content, and a renamed post carries its send log and its birthday with it.
- **A save stops claiming what it did not carry**, and a refused publish stops saying
  Published. A refusal is heard elsewhere too: a rejected rail order slides back, and a failed
  trash or redirect says so instead of looking done.
- **The newsletter send outlives the request that started it.** A thousand subscribers meant a
  thousand TLS handshakes inside one HTTP request that the server closes at two minutes, so
  the admin was told the broadcast had failed while the mail was still going out — and the
  button offered to send the whole list again. It runs in the background over three pooled
  connections now, with a progress endpoint the screen reads.

### Nothing on a page moves as the reader arrives

Measured with Chrome's own `layout-shift` entries, `buffered`, on the author's blog:

| Page | Before | After |
|---|--:|--:|
| Home, 1440 | 0.059 | **0.0000** |
| Home, 390 | 0.136 | **0.0000** |
| A post, 390 | 0.086 | **0.0000** |

- **A listing carries thirty posts and a link**, not the whole archive with most of it
  hidden: a blog with hundreds of posts rendered every one of them into the first response and
  reflowed as the images arrived. Infinite scroll fetches the next thirty two screens early,
  and a reader with no JavaScript still gets every page.
- Every reserved space that was missing is reserved: the comment thread, the newsletter panel,
  the first thumbnail is fetched early, and the dark logo is not fetched at all on a light
  page.

### Speed, measured

| What | Before | After |
|---|--:|--:|
| The admin's first frame | 1,063 KB | **375 KB** |
| The whole admin bundle | 2,471 KB | 2,423 KB |
| Reading the settings, per request | 65.5 µs | **4.8 µs** |
| A 404, against 200k analytics rows | 6.5 ms | **0** |
| An upload, against 6,144 stored files | two walks of 77.3 ms | **1.36 ms, no walk** |
| The unused-media sweep, 500 posts + 1,500 revisions | 23.3 ms | **10.0 ms** |

- **The admin fetched all eleven reader dictionaries and the editor before its first frame.**
  It fetches the one dictionary it speaks; the other ten arrive on demand, and a guard walks
  the built graph and fails if a translation is in the entry again.
- **A backup no longer holds the whole archive in memory** on the way to the browser, a `304`
  carries the same caching instructions as the `200` it revalidates, and every page stopped
  prefetching the one route that is never cached.

### Every control says what it is

- **Names on the controls that had none**: the calendar arrows, the time field, six editor
  toolbar keys, the phone's menu button. A label points at its field, and a note or a refusal
  is the field's description rather than part of its name.
- **The upload zone is a button.** It was a `<div>` with a click handler: reachable by mouse
  only, on the one screen a blog is filled from.
- **The settings strip is a real tablist** — arrows, Home/End, one tab stop for the whole
  strip instead of seven — and the drawer, the attributes sheet and the media picker are real
  dialogs that take focus, close on Escape and give focus back.
- **The skip link is the first thing a keyboard reaches on an article**, and it lands on the
  body. Twenty focusable stops stand between the top of the page and the first paragraph; the
  order is right (a contents list belongs before what it indexes) and the way past it now
  works. The admin has one too, over eighteen rail stops.
- Two reader targets under 24px grew, counts and scheduled hours print in the language the
  admin is set to, and the activity log speaks sentences rather than the sixty-one machine
  codes it stores.

### The reading site

- **One `h1` per listing page**, and the site name goes back to the left edge on every page it
  is the heading of: the rule that pushes it there stopped matching once the name became the
  page's heading, so the wordmark sat 235px into a 608px bar on the front page while an
  article had it flush left.
- **One address per document.** An old term spelling redirects instead of answering twice, the
  front door owns its canonical, leading zeros in a page number stop minting cache entries,
  and six names the router answers first — `admin`, `login`, `og`, `search`, `setup`,
  `uploads` — can no longer be taken by a post.
- **The year a post is filed under is the year the site is in**, in the feed and the archive
  both; it was the server's UTC, so a post published at nine in the evening in Saigon on 31
  December was filed under the following year.
- **A scheduled post goes out on the blog's clock**, not on the clock of the machine that
  typed it.
- The phone paints the page's own colour behind the address bar, the fade at the edge of a
  scrolled article narrows to one line there, the dark highlighter's contrast is computed
  rather than remembered, and the pen's loop round the book-mode key waits for the pointer
  instead of standing on the page.

### Mail

- **The plain-text half of every email is written by a scanner, not by a tag-strip.** No
  caller passes a text alternative, so one regular expression was writing the `text/plain`
  part of every newsletter, confirmation and reply notice: one paragraph with no line breaks,
  no addresses at all (the unsubscribe link included), raw `&nbsp;` and `&#39;` spellings, and
  the hidden inbox-preview line printed as the letter's first sentence, said twice. A link is
  now `label (address)`, block tags are line breaks, and what the HTML half hides is dropped.
- It also answers the standing CodeQL alert (`js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization`).
  Removing a bracketed run JOINS what stood either side of it, so one pass over `<scr<x>ipt>`
  hands back a working tag. The alert had twice been dismissed on the true grounds that this
  output is never an HTML context; the code was still the wrong code.

### Under the hood

- **The activity log has a retention.** It had none: it is copied whole into every backup, and
  one of the things it records is a refused sign-in, written whatever the owner's toggle says,
  so anybody could grow this blog's database one slow guess at a time. A year, a ceiling of
  20,000 rows, and refusals are trimmed first so a flood cannot push out what the owner did.
- **Cleaning up after an import stops reading the whole blog** on every batch of five images,
  and stops pushing the post's written history out with near-identical snapshots of a body
  that had not changed.
- The comment beacon stops waiting on a flush, a flood of comments costs one timestamp, and a
  search query has one length cap rather than three.
## 2026-09-06 — Quire Ink 2.2.8

Four days on how the thing moves and how it feels under a hand: one motion engine for the
reading site, the sign-in page and the admin, with one switch that finally stops all of it;
a book reader that a phone can actually read in; an admin rail you can rearrange; and the
two heaviest islands leaving every page that has not switched them on. Underneath, the
assistant stops taking orders from a comment, a blog can be claimed without reading a log,
and every install path was run again.

### One motion engine, one switch

- **Four files ARE the engine now**, and nothing else says how the product moves:
  `web/motion.css.ts` and `assets/js/motion.ts` for the reading site, the foot of
  `admin.css` and `admin/motion.ts` for the admin ([`docs/conventions/motion.md`](./docs/conventions/motion.md)
  is the contract). Three durations, and for the first time one curve, `--ease-out`, taken
  from the rail's slide and shared by every entrance. Eleven duration literals across four
  files at four values for three intents became the tokens; Tailwind's own `transition`
  utilities read the same token.
- **The Motion switch stops everything, on both sides of the door.** It did not: the admin
  gated four rules one at a time while every Tailwind transition, six loading skeletons and
  the sidebar's width kept moving; the sign-in page used tokens that resolved to nothing and
  had no gate at all; two admin scrolls and the to-top button smooth-scrolled regardless;
  and the book's page turn held a blank spread for 130ms with the switch off, because its
  timer did not know the transition had gone. One rule per gate now, on every element and
  pseudo-element, and script asks the gate rather than reading a token.
- **One scroll loop.** Four islands on a post ran four `requestAnimationFrame` loops, and the
  second one's layout reads landed after the first one's writes, a forced layout on every
  frame. Every island now watches the scroll through one loop, reads before writes.
- **Things arrive rather than appear.** The theme menu, the search and sign-up panels, the
  admin's toasts, command palette and slide-overs start a shade transparent and a few
  pixels short, in pure CSS (`@starting-style`), so the scripts are unchanged. Every control
  eases its colour at one speed under a floor rule, so nothing snaps beside a neighbour that
  eases. Three transitions on layout properties — the settings switch travelling on `left`,
  two upload bars growing by `width` — became transforms.
- **A card had two entrances.** `card-in` sat outside the scroll-fade switch and `reveal-in`
  inside it, so a feed with the fade off still rose on the way in. One entrance, one switch.
- **The admin's progress bar sweeps once per click.** Work arriving while the finished bar
  was fading used to un-mark it, and un-marking replays the keyframes from the left: a save
  followed by its refresh, or the write pane's list and then its post, drew one click twice.
  The bar now holds full until that work ends, then fades once.

### The scroll fade is one switch, and reaches the words

- `features.scrollFade` governs both halves: the cards easing in at the foot of a listing,
  and the new half, an article's running text dimming at the top and bottom of the window so
  the paragraph being read is the brightest thing on screen. Off means nothing fades
  anywhere, including the fallback armed for browsers without scroll timelines.
- Cards used to sit half-faded in the middle of the window on a feed of long posts, because
  the range was measured against each card's own height. The range is now "the card is
  inside the window", one instant with one meaning at any height.
- Not inside the paginated book, whose columns run sideways: a vertical timeline dimmed
  whichever paragraphs sat outside the window in a direction nobody was scrolling.

### A phone reads a book by scrolling

- **Below 640px book mode is not a dialog.** A modal takes the scroll off the document, and
  on iOS that means Safari keeps its address bar and toolbar for the whole read: measured at
  844px, 190px of the screen were Safari's, 56 ours, and a nineteen-page article turned a
  page every four sentences. The phone now lays the article out as one column in the
  document and scrolls the page, which hands those bars back to the words. The chrome
  follows the direction — away on the way down, back on the way up — and the phone's own
  back gesture leaves the reader rather than the article.
- **Paper to the top of the glass.** iOS tints its status bar with the document's background,
  which was the site's white, so the reader wore a white band above its paper. The document
  itself is paper while the reader is open, `theme-color` says so, and the words run under
  the clock on the way down exactly as an ordinary page does; the bar's own padding covers
  the inset while the bar shows. Seen on an iPhone 17 Pro simulator against the live site.
- The scrolled reader fades at its edges like an article, since a scrolling window cuts a
  line in half at its top edge; the paginated spread does not.
- The reading-progress bar is gone on a phone: the scrollbar already says how far in you
  are, and the bar stuttered against the address bar collapsing. Unchanged above 639px.

### The admin rail is yours to arrange

- **Every row can be moved** — the four destinations, the group they fold into, the controls
  at the foot — by dragging with a pointer or a finger, or with up/down buttons for keyboard
  and touch. Rearrange sits under Collapse. The wordmark and the search button get switches
  instead of drags, because a logo dropped into a column of destinations becomes one; with
  the wordmark off, search becomes the first row above Home.
- **The order is a site setting**, stored as ids, so it is the same on the laptop and the
  desktop and survives a label being translated eleven ways. Collapse and icons stay per
  device.
- Three faults in the first drag, fixed the same day: the row died after one move (a node
  that leaves the document loses its pointer capture, so the gesture now lives on the
  window), a moved row sprang back while the server kept the new order, and the list
  teleported instead of sliding (rows now animate from where they were, skipped behind the
  motion gate).

### No brand, if you want none

- **The dashboard's system line has a switch.** The line at its foot — `quireINK v2.2.8
  (hash) · running the latest · Bun · SQLite · the machine · uptime · View site` — is the one
  place the admin said its own name on every visit. Settings → System → Dashboard turns the
  whole line off; Settings → System still says when an update exists.
- With that, nothing of ours is forced onto your screens: the admin wordmark has a switch in
  Rearrange sidebar, the public footer is your own line or nothing, and the only place the
  software still names itself is the `generator` meta tag ([ADR 0038](./docs/decisions/0038-the-permission-reaches-the-install-people-actually-run.md)).

### Settings you can read, drafts you can tell apart

- **Group titles you can find.** Thirty-seven groups in two columns at 15px over labels at
  14px read as one object; a group now opens at 17px on a tinted band with a graphite dot.
- **Explanations have a switch.** Show explanations, at the top of Settings; off, every note
  under a setting goes, and the rows shrink with them: a switch row 65px to 41px, from the
  padding, six pixels of descender space under every switch, and the empty strip at each
  end of a list card.
- **Untitled drafts are numbered.** Several drafts saved without a title were a wall of the
  same label; each now carries a stable number, oldest first, and the dashboard's pick-up
  band uses the same numbering as the writing sidebar.
- Focus mode hid the pane on the Write screen too, where the pane is not chrome around the
  writing but the screen itself, and took the way out with it; it now hides the pane only
  beside an editor. The recovered-work strip is grey rather than amber, since nothing has
  gone wrong when it appears. Custom code moves into the Connections tab's left column,
  beside SMTP, instead of a strip stranded under both. The build line ends the dashboard's
  system line, where a phone hides it unless the install is behind.

### The reading site

- **Search and the newsletter sign-up share one panel.** They were two designs — a framed
  32rem box 8vh down with a close glyph, and a frameless 28rem card 12vh down without one.
  Same frame, width, top, heading and close now; the card inside the sign-up drops its own
  border.
- **The pen loop is a real path.** The loop drawn round "Book mode" on hover was an SVG mask,
  and Safari draws a faint dotted rectangle round a scaled mask's box (Chrome does not,
  which is why it shipped). It is an inline SVG in the button now, drawn by the vector engine
  in whichever ink the palette holds.
- **An island behind a switch is its own bundle.** Book mode was 7.8 KB and the comment
  thread 7.0 KB of a 19.6 KB `post.js`, three quarters of the file sent to every reader of a
  site with both switched off. Each is a bundle now, named on a page only when its switch is
  on; `post.js` keeps the islands every article has, at 7.1 KB. A site with both on pays the
  same bytes over two more deferred, immutable requests.

### The assistant asks before acting on what a reader wrote

- **A comment could steer the assistant.** `list_comments` hands the model text written by
  readers, and the same conversation could go on to `update_post` or `reply_comment` with no
  click from the owner; only deletes, settings and outbound actions asked. A comment saying
  "rewrite the post about X" arrived looking like any other instruction. The tool now carries
  an `untrusted` mark, and from the moment its result is in a conversation every tool that is
  not read-only stops and waits, with the pause saying why. Reads stay free, and the rule is
  read off the transcript rather than remembered, so a reopened conversation keeps it.
- **Comments in the code no longer attribute decisions to a person.** Twenty-five notes of
  the form "the owner asked for" now state the reason or the measurement instead, which is
  what the repository's own first rule requires. Fourteen lines in `docs/` followed.

### Claiming a blog without a terminal

- **`SETUP_CODE`.** Every install so far ended at "read the log": the one-time link that
  claims a blog nobody owns is printed at boot, and on a droplet, a hosting panel or a NAS
  that is the tallest step of the whole install, arriving right after the one that felt like
  the last. Set `SETUP_CODE` (twelve characters or more) in the environment and `/setup`
  asks for it in a browser instead. The proof is unchanged, since whoever wrote the
  environment owns the machine; only where the secret is read moves, from the log to the
  file the person already has. The code is compared folded (case and dashes are for reading
  it) in constant time, the claim routes now allow ten misses per address per quarter hour,
  a code too short to be a secret is ignored for the random token with a line in the banner
  saying so, and once the blog is claimed the process forgets the code and never reads it
  again. The droplet payload carries the variable; the log link remains the default.

### Every install path was run again, and three things were off

- **The container sets `no_new_privs` on itself.** Only the compose files carried
  `--security-opt no-new-privileges`; a plain `docker run`, the droplet payload and every
  NAS container UI did not, and the process read `NoNewPrivs: 0` on each of them. The
  entrypoint now passes `--no-new-privs` to `setpriv` when it drops to `PUID:PGID`, so every
  door gets it. Measured on the rebuilt image: `Uid 1000`, `NoNewPrivs 1`, and a Synology-style
  `PUID=1026 PGID=100` still adopts its folders and boots.
- **The Kubernetes manifest pinned `2.2.3` through four releases.** It now names the current
  release, and `check:docs` fails when the pin, the tag table in `dockerhub-overview.md` and
  the version line in `releases.md` disagree with `package.json`, so the next release cannot
  leave one behind.
- **`ghcr.io` still carries the withdrawn `2.3` and `2.3.4` tags** from the mistaken release
  of 2026-08-31; Docker Hub was cleaned by hand at the time and the second registry was not.
  Deleting them needs the package owner's token, so this note is the fix until then: the
  newest release is `latest`, and `2.3.x` is not a release.

### Custom code, and the policy that decides whether it runs

- **The Custom code guide said no content policy stood in the way. One usually does.** The
  app sends no `Content-Security-Policy`; the recommended nginx vhost, the `Caddyfile` and
  `deploy/caddy` all send `script-src 'self'`, and so does every install that followed them,
  which blocks a pasted snippet with a note only in the browser console. The guide now says
  which directives to widen, and `SECURITY.md` scopes its no-inline-script promise to the
  HTML the software writes rather than to the box the owner fills.

### The systemd unit in the guide gets a sandbox

- **The sample unit in `self-host.md` ran the blog with the run of the machine.** It now
  carries `NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome=read-only`
  and a `ReadWritePaths` naming the data and upload directories, which is what the author's
  own installs have run with since August. A fault in the blog stays in the blog. The guide
  says the two things that bite: the directories must exist before the first start, and a
  directory left off the list fails on the next restart rather than this one.

### Under the hood

- **The dependency audit runs on a clock.** Seven advisories (four high) sat open on `main`
  for two days after a green run, every one published after it. `bun audit` now also runs
  every Monday, on its own, without the rest of CI. The three packages named (`qs`,
  `fast-uri`, and `@tiptap/core` through five editor extensions) are bumped.
- **A tag waits for CI before it publishes.** `publish.yml` fires on the tag and `ci.yml`
  does not, so the two had never met: a release could reach both registries as `latest` on
  a commit whose tour was red. The publish workflow now reads the check runs on the tagged
  commit and refuses until all four are green, or fails naming the one that is not.
- The appearance contract's notes for the three duration tokens said 120/200/320ms for a
  month while the sheet said .15/.2/.5s; they say what the sheet says, and `--ease-out`
  joined the contract. `docs/performance.md` no longer claims there is nothing to split.

## 2026-09-02 — Quire Ink 2.2.7

Two reports from someone running the blog on Unraid, and the box this product needed in
order to keep its own promise.

### The contents list's last row goes somewhere (#63)

- **A post with no tags and no categories had a dead link.** The row said "Comments" and
  pointed at `post-comments`; the section carries `id="comments"` and always has. Measured:
  the click moved the page zero pixels.
- **On a desktop the taxonomy row aimed at a copy nobody can see.** Above the rail
  breakpoint the block under the article is `display:none` — those facts live in the gutter
  panel at the TOP of the article — so "Tag / Category" scrolled 2,615px past the end of the
  prose to a zero-height anchor and landed on "Read next" with no tag on screen. The panel
  has its own anchors now and the row follows whichever copy is rendered, re-deciding on
  resize. With no JavaScript the row keeps the server's choice, which is right at the width
  where there is no gutter.

### The whole history was always there, and now it can be asked for (#64)

- **Nothing has ever deleted an analytics row.** There is no retention setting and no
  pruning job. What was missing was the question: every window was "the last N days" and the
  widest offered was 365, so an install in its third year was holding two years it could not
  look at.
- **ALL TIME**, bucketed by month, so five years is sixty columns rather than eighteen
  hundred.
- **BY YEAR**, every calendar year on record, independent of the window above — "2024
  against 2025" is not a question about the last thirty days. Grouped in the site's own
  timezone: a UTC `strftime('%Y')` would file the first seven hours of every January on a
  UTC+7 blog into the year before.
- The trend arrow and the new/returning split are suppressed on all time, because both
  compare against the window immediately before and before all time there is nothing.
- The delivery row on that screen was also lopsided, and it is the reason the panel was
  looked at: the figures sat 36px in while every other row on the sheet sits at 20px, and
  each note was 4px out from the number it explains. Everything on that sheet is now on one
  margin; the bytes figure gained the caveat that had only ever lived in a source comment.

### A box for your own code

- **Connections → Custom code**: your own HTML in the page `<head>` and before `</body>`.
  Quire Ink still fetches nothing from anybody — a fresh install has both boxes empty — but
  what you add is your site's business. Umami, Plausible, Cloudflare's beacon, a
  verification tag.
- Kept verbatim: a field whose purpose is to carry a script cannot strip script tags.
- **Never on the admin, the sign-in page, or a draft preview.** A tracker on a preview
  reports a reader who does not exist and spoils the numbers in Analytics; one on the
  sign-in page watches a password being typed. The snippets are passed into the document
  renderer by the two public shells rather than read inside it, so a page carries them only
  by asking.
- The editor is the CSS box's sibling: line gutter, Tab indents, byte count, and it names an
  unclosed `<script>` or `<style>` — this field's unclosed brace, and worse, because the
  browser swallows the rest of the page and the site goes blank with nothing saying why.

### Under the hood

- The browser tour installs the browser this project targets instead of using whatever the
  CI runner shipped. A runner's `/usr/bin/chromium` had twice held the debugging port shut
  for a full thirty seconds; the diagnostics added in 2.2.6 are what named it.

## 2026-09-02 — Quire Ink 2.2.6

A sweep of every reader page and every admin screen at 375, 768, 1024 and 1440, in both colour
schemes, and the six faults it turned up. Five are what a phone or a keyboard met; one is a way
off the site.

### Reachable on a phone and by keyboard

- **The navigation drawer leaves the tab order when it closes.** Slid off-screen it was still in
  the document — 44 focusable links on a listing, 66 on an article, none of them visible — so a
  keyboard reader tabbed through the whole sidebar before reaching the first post. It is hidden
  once the slide finishes now; opening it moves focus to its first link and Escape hands focus
  back to the button.
- **The composed front page keeps its menu under 60rem.** The header's copy of the menu is
  desktop-only and the drawer button hides itself where there is no drawer, so on that one
  layout four configured links had nowhere to appear on a phone: reachable at 1024 and up, gone
  at 375 and 768. It now carries the same menu-only drawer a listing with its sidebar switched
  off already has.
- **The "not found" page offers a way on.** It had one link home; it now carries the search box
  — a mistyped or moved URL usually has its title in it — and the three newest posts, and still
  answers 404.

### Two overflows on narrow admin screens

- **The activity feed no longer scrolls the dashboard sideways by a pixel** — its rows are grid
  items, whose minimum width is their content until told otherwise.
- **Settings → Appearance fits a 375px screen.** The key-volume slider and its preview button,
  373px together, were handed their full width by a shrink-0 box that never lets its own content
  wrap; capped at the row, the pair drops to a second line where there is no room for one. It
  ran 52px past the edge before.

### A redirect a control character could steer

- **The post-sign-in destination rejects any control character, whitespace or backslash.** It
  already refused `//evil.example` and `/\evil.example`, but a tab after the leading slash —
  `/<TAB>/evil.example` — passed both checks and arrived in the browser as `//evil.example`,
  because the URL parser strips tab, newline and carriage return before it reads a URL.
  Reproduced against a running server, then closed for the whole class on both redirect
  sanitisers.

### Under the hood

- **A browser that will not start now says why.** When the tour's Chrome fails to open its
  debugging port its stderr and exit code are reported instead of a bare timeout, and the three
  shapes of that failure — the process died, the port never answered, the port answered with no
  page — are told apart. A CI flake on the 2.2.5 release commit left nothing anybody could read;
  this is that gap closed.

## 2026-09-01 — Quire Ink 2.2.5

Ten commits in one day, and the day was one long consequence: four names left the CDN that had
been in front of them, and everything that had quietly been relying on it came up for air. Two
of the things that came up were security defects. The rest is what an origin has to do for
itself once nothing is standing in front of it.

### The origin now does its own compression

- **Brotli, not only gzip.** A cold visit to a post falls from 49,960 bytes to 36,717 — 22% on
  the wire, measured through a real proxy. The pen's sheets are where it stops being a rounding
  error: `pen-marks.css` goes 11,838 → 5,928.
- The file said "not Brotli" and gave two reasons. Both were re-measured and neither held. The
  first was 2.9%, which is true at quality **4** — the worst rung on the ladder; q5 saves 7.7%
  and is faster, q11 saves 17.6%. The second was that the CDN re-compresses anyway: it does for
  HTML, and it does **not** for the hashed immutable assets, which came back from a live edge
  carrying the origin's own gzip byte for byte. Those are what every first-time reader
  downloads.
- **The expensive quality only where the answer is kept forever**, and only up to 192 KB. The
  ceiling was found by the browser tour, not by reasoning: the admin's chunks are hashed and
  immutable too and twenty times the size, so without it a 644 KB bundle went through 642 ms of
  synchronous compression on the first admin load and stalled the whole process. `check:all`
  was green through all of it.
- **A returning reader downloads nothing.** Every 200 carries a strong `ETag` and answers
  `If-None-Match` with a 304. A warm browser cache was re-fetching 8,179 bytes of HTML per
  view with every other resource already at zero.

### Two headers that anyone could send

- **`CF-Connecting-IP` is believed only when a Cloudflare zone is configured** in Settings.
  It was read from any local hop, and only Cloudflare overwrites it — so behind any other
  proxy a caller could pick their own rate-limit bucket. Measured through a real Caddy: 45
  requests against a 30-per-minute cap, a different made-up value on each, **zero refused**;
  the same 45 without the header, 16 refused.
- **`CF-IPCountry` gets the same gate.** `/api/track` is an open POST, so the owner's "where
  they came from" panel could be filled with countries nobody visited from. Wrong data that
  looks right is worse than the empty column it replaces.
- Both were found by listing every request header the application reads and asking which of
  them a client can choose. The same sweep cleared the rest: the CSRF check stands on
  `Sec-Fetch-Site`, `x-forwarded-proto` is overwritten by both shipped proxies, and public
  pages are byte-identical for a stranger and a signed-in owner, so the new ETag cannot serve
  one reader's page to another.

### A certificate, whichever way you came in

- **Every install path that can have one now brings one.** Six were audited; two ended in
  HTTPS. `deploy/caddy/setup.sh` is one command for the install that runs straight on the
  machine, and the DigitalOcean file gains one editable line that brings the droplet up on
  HTTPS with the certificate already issued.
- **`docker-compose.image.yml`** gives the `docker pull` path what the checkout already had:
  two files, no source, a certificate that renews itself.
- **One `Caddyfile` for all three shapes**, so the content security policy the application is
  tested against is the one that ends up in front of it. `CADDY_DOMAIN` is gone — Caddy takes
  the certificate's name out of `SITE_URL`.
- `http2 on;` in the nginx sample, which never asked for it and therefore never had it.

### Reading

- **A wide table scrolls its own box now, not the whole article.** The scroll sat on `.prose`,
  and CSS gives no way to scroll one axis alone — so an article carrying a single table became
  a scroll box as tall as the piece, and Safari drew a scrollbar down the side of the reading
  column and took that width out of the text. Reported from a reading window.
- **The book-mode control answers a click the way it answers a pointer.** Its hover draws a pen
  loop and its press was taking a carved rectangle from the shared key vocabulary, so one
  control replied to the mouse with a circle and to the click with a square.

### Boot

- **The stylesheet minifier gathers instead of appending.** It built its result one character
  at a time over 417 KB, which is 417,000 rope allocations: physical footprint rose 109 MB
  during those three calls. It is 2.2 MB now, and a warm instance's boot peak fell from 240 MB
  to 157 MB — which is the number a container limit has to be set from.

### What this version does NOT do

- **A NAS and a Kubernetes cluster get no Caddy, on purpose.** A NAS already holds ports 80 and
  443 with its own certificate UI, and a cluster terminates TLS at its ingress. Everywhere else
  the certificate comes with the install.
- **`docker compose up` does not fetch a newer image.** On a machine that had pulled once
  before, `latest` started a blog two releases behind the tag it named, printed a claim link
  and looked entirely correct. Upgrading is `pull` then `up -d`.
- **An install that injects into its own HTML loses the origin's compression and its ETag.**
  Anything using nginx `sub_filter` has to ask upstream for plain text, and nginx drops the
  validator when it rewrites a body. The hashed assets can be excepted; the pages cannot.
- **Nothing here buys back a round trip.** Compression and validators save bytes; on an origin
  with no CDN in front, a distant reader still pays the handshake. Measured from Asia to a US
  origin: a `304` carrying zero bytes still took 623 ms. The 22% is real and it is not a CDN.
- **HTTP/3 only where the proxy has it.** Caddy advertises it; the nginx sample does not,
  because that needs a QUIC-capable build.

## 2026-09-01 — Quire Ink 2.2.4

Seventy-five commits over two days. Under plain semver the assistant's streaming, ⌘K, the
security screen and the per-block rail switches would each have been a minor on their own;
the owner took the patch slot again, which is the fifth release running.

### The assistant

- **A fourth provider: DeepSeek.** It speaks OpenAI's protocol verbatim, so it is a base URL
  in one table rather than a fourth dialect — and that table is read by the chat loop and by
  every other AI job, so a provider that works in the chat box works everywhere.
- **Answers stream as they are written**, on all four providers, each verified against a live
  key: OpenAI sends delta fragments, Anthropic names its events and builds blocks by index,
  Gemini and DeepSeek differ again.
- **Conversations are kept and listed** beside the chat, the way the writing screen lists
  pieces (ADR 0040). They used to live in one browser tab.
- **A receipt**: what the assistant did, and what it cost.
- **A stop button** — a hand on the brake mid-answer.
- **A "test this key" button on the AI card**, which is the one question that card could not
  answer before.
- Five separate faults that only a real provider could report, all on a path that was green
  at 2488 tests, and a token ceiling that had been hiding behind them.

### Finding things

- **⌘K opens a command palette** that jumps straight to any setting, so it stops mattering
  which of the eight tabs holds it.
- **All 245 leaf settings are indexed by name** — and the MCP tools read the same index, so
  an agent can now write any of them. It could write three.
- The rail prints the shortcut, because a shortcut cannot be found by looking for it.
- Search moved up to the wordmark row.

### The owner can defend their own account

Settings → Security has been described in the spec since it was written and existed nowhere:

- change the password, re-enrol 2FA, regenerate the recovery codes;
- every signed-in device listed, revoked one at a time or all at once;
- **a way back in when both the password and the second factor are gone.** Resetting the
  password alone never rescued anybody — the next sign-in still stopped at a code prompt.

### Writing

- **Four faults that changed the published page on save.** Nineteen of the 45 golden
  fixtures came out differently after one pass through the editor and nothing could say so:
  - footnotes and callouts were escaped on every save, so `[^1]` became `\[^1\]` — which
    this renderer reads as display maths. The reader got an empty formula mid-sentence, and
    `[!NOTE]` came out as MathML spelling N-O-T-E;
  - table alignment was written back flat, so every centred and right-aligned column went
    left on the first save and stayed there;
  - three pictures came back on one line and the page put three `<figure>` elements inside a
    `<p>`, which the browser closes early — every rule written for `article > figure`
    stopped matching.
  - 26 of 45 fixtures published identically before; 37 now, and the eight remaining
    differences are Markdown's own normalisations, each named with the reason.
- **Six keyboard chords**, from one table the Help screen prints from: save the draft, add or
  edit a link, highlighter, ring, strip every mark, the Attributes panel, the Markdown
  source. `Mod-S` is not a convenience — autosave writes to localStorage and never to the
  server, so a writer pressing it used to get the browser's "Save page as…" dialog.
- **The write pane can bin several pieces at once**, as a mode rather than a trash icon
  living a few pixels from the title.
- The scope strip beside the paper stops wearing the pen.
- Clicking a row in the write pane swaps the sheet and nothing else.
- **A Vietnamese IME gets its keystroke sounds back** — a composing keystroke is still a
  keystroke.

### Analytics

- **Three numbers were wrong.** "Bounce rate" means a single-page session everywhere it is
  used and there are no sessions in this schema, so the overview now says what it actually
  counts.
- **The beacon was deleting the bounce cohort** before anything could count it.
- **A way into any single piece's numbers.**
- CSV export is gone, with its locale key in eleven languages.

### The reading site

- **The menu stopped disappearing (#61)**, reported from an Unraid install. With the homepage
  set to *A page*, or to *Post list* with the sidebar off, or on any post at all, the
  configured links were in the served HTML zero times at every width. The rail is the menu's
  home, so an article's rail now leads with the menu above its contents, and a listing whose
  sidebar is off keeps a rail carrying the menu alone. The front page keeps its header menu.
- **The header row wraps** at every width: a title, a menu of any length and up to five
  controls do not fit in a 672px reading column.
- **The click, in whichever ink the reader's palette holds.**
- **Book mode is circled in the pen** on hover, not boxed in grey, and its target is a
  target.
- **The archive is set as an index**: one type size per row instead of two, and the year
  jumps moved onto the title's own line instead of floating in the gap.
- **Sixteen bold words the heading-weight setting could not reach** — five sheets wrote 600
  where the token belonged.
- The series card is drawn in the site's own marks.
- The footer names the machine, not the kernel. It printed `Linux 7.0`.

### The admin, in relief

The whole surface learned what it is made of, and the grammar is two words: **raised means
pressable, carved means held.**

- A button stands 1–2px proud of the sheet with a light lip along its top edge; pressing
  moves the light to the bottom inside edge and drops the outside shadow to nothing. **The
  press lands at once** and only the release is sprung. Reduced motion keeps the surface
  change and drops the travel.
- A field holds a value, so it is carved. So is a chosen tab, an active toolbar button, and
  the current page in the rail — all of them keys held down.
- Solid ink shows no relief, so the black key is shaded by light instead of shadow.
- **One pen at one strength** wherever "where you are" is marked, and white ink on it in dark
  mode: near-black on the dark olive measured 3.8:1 against the 4.5 a label must clear.
- **One hand draws every icon** — one shared set for both faces.
- The colour picker stops being drawn by the operating system; the palette card is a held
  key and the swatch an ink well.
- The newsletter's send button is a latch: arm it, read the count, press again.
- Ten languages take a dropdown instead of a strip.
- **Controls came down a step**, 40px to 36, button and field together; a sheet's tools row
  is 32 throughout — the tab strip, the key and the field on one height.
- **Enclosure weakens inward.** A box inside a card was drawn heavier than the card; a list
  is ruled top and bottom now instead of boxed, at the card's full width.
- **One shape for an empty image slot.** There were five, no two alike, and three of them
  changed the row's height the moment a picture went in.
- The rail's seam is a recess rather than a drawn line, so structure reads as depth and a
  sheet's edge as a hairline.
- The dropzone is a well; the last two typed crosses became drawn ones; the terminal chrome
  trades pictures for words.

### Screens that had only been looked at once

- **A folded phone at 280px**: the bar ran 18px past the edge and the clipped control was
  the menu button.
- **An unfolded foldable at 673px**: book mode handed it one 577px column, 39px short of a
  spread, with the crease down the middle of every line.
- **An iPad, which the user agent refuses to describe** — iPadOS sends a Macintosh string on
  purpose.
- **A tab strip that lost half its tabs and looked finished.** At 360px four of the eight
  settings tabs were past the edge and unreachable by touch, not merely clipped.
- The shell measures in `dvh`, because the iPad's toolbar is not part of the viewport.

### The Library

Reported from a library of 78 pictures:

- selecting an image was slow — measured 1.60ms per click, now 0.70ms;
- hover and selection did not press in;
- **shift-click selects a run.**
- The two chrome rows are one.
- An image variant born mid-export is no longer counted as a lost upload.

### Settings and the home screen

- **Every rail block has its own switch** — archive, series, tags, categories.
- Save moved onto the sheet's tools row, from a bar fixed to the bottom of the window that
  had been reported as missing entirely.
- Six settings that were taking two lines to ask one question now take one.
- Custom CSS gets a guard and a front door.
- **The recent-activity card became a feed**, and a settings save records which paths it
  changed instead of going in blank.
- The home screen opens with the owner's name and says what version is running and whether
  it is current.

### Under it

- **Eleven lines nothing was watching.** Found by breaking one line at a time in the thirteen
  most load-bearing files and asking which test goes red.
- The editor's corpus suite gained a second law: render both sides and compare the HTML. The
  old law — serialize twice, compare — passes a document that is stably wrong, which is why
  all six footnote fixtures were green while the feature was gone.
- The tour stops clicking by paint.
- `docs/appearance.md` had been sending readers to an Appearance → Advanced tab that does not
  exist.

## 2026-08-30 — Quire Ink 2.2.3

**Cut twice.** The first v2.2.3 went out at 20:19 UTC and was withdrawn thirty-one minutes
later: a reader running it on Unraid reported that the admin offers no way to move a post to
the Trash, and it turned out to be a thirteen-day regression rather than a design choice. The
tag and the release were deleted and remade with the fix in them. **Anyone who pulled `2.2.3`
or `latest` inside that half hour has the build without it and should pull again** — the
number cannot tell them apart, which is the cost of reusing it.

Twenty-six commits in a day, and the owner took the patch slot again — under plain semver
the year archive, the per-archive feeds, offline reading, the table settings and the shape
knobs would each have been a minor on their own. Two threads run through it. One is
**giving the blog a way back into its own past**: until this release a five-year-old post
was reachable only through a tag, through search, or by paging back through the listing.
The other is **saying out loud what was only ever implied** — five buttons that announced
the same word, a permission that did not cover the install its own guide teaches, a
repository that quoted its owner in sixty places, and a licence condition with nothing in
the software to bite on.

One default changes what an existing blog looks like, and one adds a URL to it. Both are
named where they land, below.

### The admin gets back the button that puts a post in the Trash

**Nothing in the admin could trash anything.** `/admin/trash` has been there since the port,
`DELETE /api/posts/:slug` has always answered, and the browser tour has proved that endpoint on
every run — by calling it. The SPA never did, on any screen. The control went with the old
content table on 2026-08-17, when the Write screen became two panes: `RowActions` carried the
trash icon and the fetch behind it, and neither was rebuilt into `WritePane`. It was missing
from v2.1.0 through the first v2.2.3, and it was reported from outside — an Unraid install,
issue #60 — rather than found here.

**Nothing caught it because every test that touches the trash reaches for the API.** A test
that calls the endpoint cannot see a missing button. There is a flow now that clicks the
control: it opens a post from the Write pane, opens Attributes, presses Move to Trash, waits
for the public URL to answer 404, checks the piece is listed in Trash and puts it back. The
first version of that flow used an iframe and the tour refused it, because
`x-frame-options: DENY` is on every response and should be; it drives the SPA in the same
document instead.

**Move to Trash sits at the foot of the Attributes panel**, under its own rule, as the outlined
red button `ui/Button` already calls the red ballpoint. It went first into the panel's header
line beside History and View post, and opening that screen is what moved it: three items in one
row, one grey, one weight, and the third of them deletes the post — a destructive action
dressed as a third navigation link. It is not in the editor's button row either; that row is
measured, and at 390px a fourth button pushes Publish off the edge. Reaching it means scrolling
past the slug, the date, the terms, both pictures and the SEO fields, which is the right amount
of deliberation for the one control that takes a piece off the site.

The confirmation says the piece can be restored, because this delete is soft — the row keeps
its body, its revisions and its slug. The strings it replaces said the action could not be
undone, which was never true of this endpoint; they had sat unused in eleven languages since
the control disappeared, and that dangling pair was the one mechanical trace of the loss.
Nothing was watching for it.

Also here: **`server.json` was two releases behind**, at `2.2.1`. It is the manifest the MCP
registry publishes from — the one file an outside directory reads to say what version this is —
and the release checklist named four places to change while this was a fifth. `check:docs` pins
it to `package.json` now, and the checklist says five.

### The blog gets a way back into its own past

**`/archive` is every published post on one page**, newest year first, as rows of `MM-DD`
and a title — no excerpt, no thumbnail, because two hundred of them have to stay scannable.
Measured on a live blog: twelve years and seventy-five posts, one request. One page rather
than `/archive/2024` per year, because a year route mints a URL with a dozen rows on it and
splits the one view worth having; the years are anchors, so the jump row at the top costs
nothing. The way in is the sidebar, a list of years with counts, above the tags because a
tag cloud is the one rail block with no ceiling on its length.

**On by default.** An upgrade therefore adds a URL and a sidebar block to a blog that did
not ask for one. It is one switch in Settings → Reading, and the reasoning for the default
is that a blog with no archive has no surface that shows it whole.

**A page or post already published at `/archive` wins**, and the year index gives way
silently. That is not politeness: this repository's own demo had exactly such a page, and
every site imported from WordPress could. A release that takes over a live URL is the
failure an upgrade is least forgiven for. The sitemap then names the URL once, as the
document it really is.

The year is read off the ISO string rather than from `new Date(...).getFullYear()`. The
stored value is UTC, and a post published on 1 January at 02:00 UTC files itself under the
previous year on any host west of Greenwich. The date column is numeric for a related
reason: a month name needs each language's own day/month order — "19 tháng 6" against
"June 19" — which is a twelfth locale string and a per-language branch for a column five
characters wide. The full date is on the `<time>` element for anything reading the document
rather than looking at it. Below 34rem the date moves above its title instead of holding a
fifth of the line.

**A feed per archive**: `/category/:slug/feed.xml`, `/tag/:slug/feed.xml` and
`/series/:slug/feed.xml`. A reader who follows one subject had to take all fifty posts or
nothing. Gated on the same `seo.rss` as the site feed and deliberately not a second switch —
an owner who has turned the feed off has already answered the question about feeds. A term
no public post carries answers 404 rather than serving an empty channel, because an empty
feed reads as a broken site to an aggregator. Each archive page advertises its own with a
second `rel="alternate"` beside the site's.

The `self` link is the URL the document was fetched from, and that is the trap in this
feature: point it at `/feed.xml` and an aggregator following it swaps the reader's chosen
subject for the whole blog, with nothing on the page they clicked from to show it.

### Reading with no signal

A service worker, and the first thing to say about it is that it is **off by default**. One
outlives the page that installed it, so putting one on every existing blog's readers because
the software updated would be the owner's decision being assumed rather than respected.
ADR 0039 records it, and it supersedes exactly one line — `seo-pwa.md` said offline was out
of scope by design, which is why the manifest made the site installable and a tunnel made it
blank. It does not reopen the rejection of a service worker as a *prefetch* mechanism in
`performance.md`; nothing here speculates.

**Nothing is fetched that the reader did not ask for.** A page is in the cache because it
was read. HTML is network-first, so online the reader always gets what the server just
rendered — that is the failure this feature could most easily cause, and it is designed out
rather than mitigated. `/assets/<hash>.*` and `/fonts/*` are cache-first because those URLs
are immutable by construction: a deploy changes the bytes, which changes the hash, which
changes the URL. Forty pages, bounded by count rather than by bytes, because `Cache.put`
reports no size without reading the body.

`/admin`, `/api`, `/preview`, `/og`, `/setup`, `/login`, every non-GET and every other origin
are untouched, so nothing the owner does passes through it and nothing private is left on a
shared machine.

**Turning it off uninstalls it.** `data-sw` is absent from `<body>` when the feature is off,
and the island reads that absence as *unregister and drop every `quire-` cache*. It runs on
every public page because the switch can only take effect on a page the reader happens to
load, and most of those are listings. That half is two thirds of the 676 bytes (235 gzipped)
the feature cost; registering alone would have been cheaper and would have made the switch a
one-way door. The core budget moved 10,500 → 11,000 with the price written into the diff.

Served at `/sw.js` rather than `/assets/sw.<hash>.js`: a worker's scope is the directory its
script came from, and under `/assets/` it would install, activate and never see a page. The
build rides in `?v=<hash>`, which is what makes a deploy an update and what stops a new
worker reading the old one's caches. `no-cache`, never `immutable` — it is the one file
whose staleness a reload cannot fix, because a browser keeps serving from the worker it
already has.

**Proved by killing the server.** With the worker installed and one article read, the process
was stopped and the article re-opened: full text, correct typeface, 575 words. The eager
prefetch was measured too, not assumed — this site prefetches every safe link, so if those
requests reached the worker one listing would fill the cache with pages nobody opened. A
top-level page with 133 links, worker in control: zero entries after six seconds.

### Tables stop being four declarations

A table was: collapse the borders, fill the column, box every cell in a hairline, pad it. A
`<th>` had no ground, no weight beyond the browser's bold and no rule under it, so a header
row was one more row.

**One set for the whole blog**, which is the design and not a limitation. GFM has no syntax
for a tint or a rule, so per-table control means an attribute inside the Markdown — and then
a table you paste in is no longer a table you can paste out. Measured against a real article
of six tables (one timeline of three short columns, five reference tables with cells past
150 characters): they were all one kind.

Seven knobs, each a different mechanism rather than a number — how the header is marked
(plain / tint / rule / inverted), which lines are drawn (every cell / rows only / none), the
line weight, banded rows, a first column carrying the header's weight, cell padding, and what
happens when the column is narrower than the table wants.

⚠️ **`head: 'tint'` is the one default in this product that does not reproduce the previous
rendering.** Every other settings group has shipped defaults that moved nothing on upgrade.
`plain` + *every cell* is the old rendering, one click away, named in `docs/appearance.md` and
asserted by a test, because the doc now makes a promise.

The tint was measured rather than picked. Mixing `--c-rule` into the page — the move
`--c-code-panel` makes one file over — gives a contrast ratio of 1.053, a band you have to be
told is there, because a rule colour is already almost the paper. Mixing the *ink* instead, 6%
of `--c-text`, gives 1.121 in light and 1.109 in dark from one declaration, with the band
lifting off a dark page instead of pressing into it.

Two wrong answers came before that, and **both passed the string tests; only the rendered page
caught them**. `--tbl-head-fg: var(--c-heading)` darkened the header ink of every table on
every blog, from `#262626` to `#121212`, while `plain` claimed to change nothing. `inherit`
then looked like the fix and is worse: a CSS-wide keyword in a custom property makes it
inherit itself, which at `:root` is nothing, so it computes to guaranteed-invalid and every
reader silently takes the `var()` fallback — which was `--c-heading`, the exact colour being
avoided. A test now rejects the whole keyword class.

The phone case is a knob, not a fix. `.prose` has carried `overflow-x:auto` since it was
written and for a table of sentences it had never once engaged, because a table that can
shrink never overflows. Measured at 375px: first column 105px, one row 551px tall, seven rows
totalling 2,334px, no scrollbar. A minimum column of 11rem gives 176px, 312px and 1,528px —
and sends a three-column timeline sideways to save one pixel of height. So it is offered,
defaulted off, and both numbers are written down.

The editor gets the block too: it is a `.prose` surface, and without it an owner who chose an
inverted header would be writing against a tinted one.

### A post can show its own picture, say who wrote it, and change shape

`featuredImage` has been stored, resized and served since the port, and a reader could only
ever meet it on a share card or a newspaper-mode front page. The article never showed it and
the ordinary post list had no `<img>` in it at all, so a blog about objects could not put a
picture on its own front door without changing its whole homepage layout.

**The shapes are the design's, not a question.** A list row offers no picture, a small square
beside the words, or a large 3:2 above the title; an article offers no cover or a 3:2 cover.
A ratio picker shipped and came out again the same day: one blog's pictures should look like
one blog's pictures. **Both positions arrive off** — an upgrade must not redesign somebody's
archive. The cover sits **above** the headline, which is what a magazine does and the order a
reader wants.

There is no full-bleed hero, and that is a measurement rather than a taste. At a 672px column
on a 1440 viewport the left rail measures 126–376 and a broken-out hero started at 264,
printing over the table of contents. The band between the rails is eight pixels either side
and does not grow with the viewport, because the rails are positioned against the column.

**The page no longer jumps.** `postImage()` emitted an `<img>` with no width or height, so on
a list of three thumbnails every box measured `height: 0` until its file landed. Thumbnails
are pinned by CSS `aspect-ratio`, the hero carries its intrinsic size, and both list and
article measure CLS 0 — structurally rather than luckily.

**And the cards stopped asking for a 1024px file to fill a 96px box.** `front-card.ts` carried
a second copy of the srcset builder and the copy had drifted, naming 1024 and 1600 only; the
512 width exists precisely for pictures that do not hold the reading column. Measured on a
nine-card list, the same nine pictures: **798 KB at 1024w, 242 KB at 512w**. One builder now,
shared, and the copy is gone.

**Who wrote it.** There was no owner-name setting at all, so every `BlogPosting` this software
has ever emitted went out with no `author` — the field search engines lean on hardest when
deciding whether a page was written by somebody. Name, bio, portrait and link; an empty name
means silence, and an existing blog stays silent. The byline is emitted twice on purpose:
`.post-meta` is hidden above the rail breakpoint because the same facts live in the right
gutter there, so a byline that lived only in that line was invisible on every desktop. Found
by opening the page, not by a test.

**Shape**, which nothing could change before: density, corner radius and headline weight — the
first knobs that move shape rather than colour. Three live blogs were measured running 84
editable colour fields and 27 type numbers between them, and the entire visible difference was
two colour values nobody can see. Every default reproduces today exactly.

**SEO**, from the project's own *not carried over yet* list: the `/page/1` and `/sitemaps.xml`
redirects, category and tag entries plus per-post `<image:image>` in the sitemap, and the
three-group crawler policy restored verbatim from the frozen tree. Search and AI bots share one
`Allow`, as they did in 1.x — whether to block an AI crawler is the owner's call and would need
a switch, not a default.

And **`docs/appearance.md`**, which did not exist: the owner's map of every knob, the CSS
variables and class names custom CSS may target, and an honest list of what cannot be changed.
`customCss` appeared in zero markdown files before this, and an escape hatch nobody was told
about is not an escape hatch.

### Analytics learns what a page costs, and what the cache is doing

Two numbers under the chart, and most of the work was making sure neither claims to be
something bigger.

**Page weight** is the reader's own browser summing `transferSize` across Navigation and
Resource Timing. It rides the *leave* beacon beside the dwell, and that was the one real design
decision: the view row is written the moment a page activates, while its stylesheets, fonts and
pictures are still arriving, so a count taken then is short by most of the page. The column
therefore sits on `analytics_scroll`, and a test asserts it is **not** on the events table.

It is *reader* bytes and the admin says so in eleven languages. A bot, a feed reader and anyone
with JavaScript off all download bytes and report none, and a CDN answers most requests without
the origin hearing about them. The denominator always travels with the total, because a total
shown alone reads a partly-measured month as a cheap one. A zero is kept as a zero, since that
is what a fully cached page really costs.

**Page cache** is counted at the single line that decides hit from miss, after the 404 check so
a crawler inventing URLs cannot drive the rate to nothing. The panel says which cache it is and
that the edge's own rate is invisible from here, because a blog can read low and still be served
almost entirely by a CDN. There is no CDN integration for it: that would be per-provider, and
ADR 0033 keeps this product CDN-neutral on purpose.

`analytics.db` had no migration ledger and needed one — `if not exists` cannot add a column to a
table that already exists. It has the same one `quire.db` uses now, and step `a001-visit-bytes`
is the first entry.

**The chart also stopped opening on a sliver of a day.** A "30 days" chart drew thirty-one
columns, and column 0 covered 0.10 of a day: it showed 1 view beside the next day's 29 and read
as a collapse in traffic that never happened. Worse, the sliver's width was the time of day, so
two screenshots taken hours apart disagreed about the same day. The window is aligned to the
bucket in the site's own zone now. The previous-period comparison had to move with it, or every
comparison would have opened showing a fall, on every blog, on the day this shipped.

### Six locked doors

One sweep closing a review's findings. Nothing here changes what a page looks like; all of it
changes what can go wrong silently.

- **`/api/cron` fails closed** without `CRON_SECRET`. *Unset means open* was an unauthenticated
  lever on the most expensive work the process does.
- **Stored files outside the renderable families download instead of rendering.** One MIME-map
  entry used to stand between an attachment and same-origin HTML.
- **Image uploads are byte-sniffed**: extension, declared type and content must agree before a
  file enters the store.
- **The comment stamp's answer comes from `randomInt`**, not `Math.random` — a predictable
  answer skips the entire proof-of-work.
- **Preview links expire after 30 days**, with the expiry inside the signature. The old tokens
  never expired at all.
- **Recovery codes are rate-limited per user as well as per IP**: the per-IP toll resets with
  every fresh address while the argon2id bill lands on one machine.
- **MCP OAuth loopback goes through the consent page.** GET auto-approve meant any web page
  could walk a signed-in owner into handing a code to whatever listened on a local port.
- **MCP tokens carry a scope** (ADR 0037). `read` registers only the tools marked read-only;
  `full` stays the default so existing connectors keep working. An unmarked tool is a write
  tool — the dangerous default is the one that fails safe.
- **The bundled Caddyfile's CSP matches the nginx one** the docs and production already run.
  It had `unsafe-inline`, which made it a CSP in name only.
- **Snapshots are on by default** (4 days, keep 4). Off-by-default meant the install that never
  opens Settings ran with no backup at all.
- **`/api/track` verifies a path is real content** before it becomes a row. The beacon was an
  open POST and any script could seed analytics with fabricated paths.

Structurally: **Invariant 1 is enforced by the router**, like Invariant 4 always was — the owner
gate flushes the cache after every successful write, and the MCP door wraps every write tool the
same way, so ~45 hand-placed `clearCache()` calls stop being the only thing between a save and a
stale page. **The admin view contract is typed**, and its first compile caught a real drift: the
client's `Range` type omitted the 90-day window the server honours. **The tour runs in CI** — it
was built to close exactly the blind spot `check:all` admits to, and then lived only as a command
someone had to remember, which is how six bugs cleared 1,954 green tests. Sixteen mount tests
render the heavy admin screens with a real React root.

### The permission reaches the install people actually run

Two gaps between the licence exception and the software it was written about. Neither touches the
line the exception exists to draw: commercial use of a modified copy still needs a separate
licence.

**Section 2(a) required that what you run is a release published by the licensor**, and every
from-source path puts you on the default branch instead — both guides say `git clone`, and
`install.sh` does `git clone --depth 1` then `git pull --ff-only`. No tag is checked out anywhere.
So somebody following the official guide and earning from their blog was, on the text, outside the
permission. Docker was fine, because `:latest` is the newest release. Two documented install paths,
two different licences, and nothing saying which was which. 2(a) turns on **unchanged** now rather
than on **tagged**, which is the condition that carried the intent in the first place. Licence
version 1.1, both language texts moved together.

**And nothing in the software carried the name 2(c) asks be kept.** Measured on the live demo: no
`<meta name="generator">`, and the only public mention of Quire Ink was the footer — which is a
setting, and 2(a) says in as many words that a setting is not a change to the source. A licensee
could delete every trace of the software's name from their pages without modifying a line of code
and still be inside the permission. The page names itself now where no setting reaches, pinned by
a test. It is not a lock and is not meant to be: anyone modifying the source can remove it, and
removing it is then a source change, which is precisely the line being drawn.

ADR 0038 records it and amends ADR 0023, whose grant is unchanged.

### The daily check runs on a clock, and counts networks instead of guessing

The number this project reads to decide what to build next could not tell a blog somebody runs
from a container somebody made and deleted, and it was low by an amount nobody could measure.

**It fires from the hourly tick as well as from a reader.** It had only ever been middleware on the
public request path, so a blog that was running, updated and healthy but had no visitor that day
never asked and was counted as not there. On a personal blog that is most days.

**Four new fields, and every one is a step**: age since the blog was claimed, how much is published,
`docker` or `source`, and the admin's language. Age is the one that matters — it separates a blog
somebody still runs from one made and deleted, which no count of daily tokens can do. A field
precise enough to be a fingerprint would undo the token, so the steps are wide and an unknown field
is absent rather than empty. The sentence the owner reads before deciding moved with the protocol,
in all eleven languages: it said *never your numbers*, and a coarse post count is a number of theirs.

**The receiving end derives a coarse network** — /24 for IPv4, /32 for IPv6 — never an address and
never anything naming a machine, then keeps one integer per day and no network at all. A fresh
database mints a fresh token, so one person recreating a container four times and four people were
the same picture; counting networks makes the number accurate rather than identifiable. ADR 0036
records why the check is on by default, which three documents described and none explained.

### The editor's selection bar says what it does

Audited by measuring rather than looking: four widths, both themes, three modes, the toolbar's
stickiness, the markdown mirror, and the accessible name of every control.

**The five inks had one name.** Each swatch carried a `title` reading *Highlighter* and nothing
else — no text, no `aria-label` — so five buttons announced the same word, told apart only by an
inline background colour. Anything not reading colour was offered five controls it could not choose
between. The names existed in all eleven languages already, because the settings screen has always
labelled the same five pickers. **The rest of the bar announced single letters**: content beats
`title` when a browser computes an accessible name, so the tooltip a mouse could see said the right
thing while a screen reader read out `B`, `I`, `H`, `U`, `O`, `S`. Thirteen buttons, thirteen
distinct names now, and a test pins the ink half across all eleven languages — including that no two
inks share a word, since a translation that collapsed two would put the bug back silently.

**And the bar offers the heading levels a body actually uses.** It was one button hard-wired to H2,
justified by a note saying the deeper levels live behind `/` and the `#` shortcuts. Neither survives
being tested: the slash menu opens only on an empty paragraph, and a selection has content by
definition, so that door is shut in exactly the case the bubble bar exists for. `### ` does work on
an existing line — but it is a markdown shortcut nobody discovers from a toolbar. H2, H3 and H4 now,
each with its own name and pressed state. Not H1: the post title is the H1.

Found while measuring for room, and worse than the thing reported: the bar was 411px of buttons with
`nowrap` and no width bound, so on a 375px phone the Link button sat off the right edge with nothing
to scroll. It wraps now, capped at `min(32rem, 100vw − 1.5rem)` — measured, after a first guess of
30rem folded a desktop bar that had the room.

What was checked and is fine, so nobody re-checks it: no horizontal overflow at 390, 768, 1024 or
1440; the toolbar is sticky at 4,000px of scroll; the writing measure is 72 characters; dark mode
reads 12.3:1 for prose and 13.4:1 for the toolbar; the markdown mirror and its textarea sit at a 0px
offset in all three dimensions. Not fixed, because it is a trade rather than a defect: every control
in the editor is 36×36, which clears WCAG 2.2 AA and misses the 44pt the admin's own note cites —
making the forty of them 44 would take the phone toolbar from three rows to four.

### The settings screen stops shouting its small print

**The palettes had lost their colour, literally.** A palette unchecked from the visitor switcher
carried `grayscale opacity-60` on its swatch, so hiding Sepia from readers turned Sepia grey *in the
editor*, on a palette that is still fully editable. `admin-design.md` had already written the rule
this shipped against. Hidden is a dashed edge now. The swatch also drew four of the seven colours,
six of which are near-white or near-black in every built-in palette: measured on the Sepia card,
28×4 pixels per mode was the only genuinely coloured element — 3.2% of the card — so Mono, Sepia and
Forest read as three identical grey stripes. The accent gets area now.

**A card's title was smaller than the labels inside it.** `Card panel` hard-typed a 13px heading
above 14px labels above 13px notes, so the hierarchy ran backwards and the heading was exactly the
size of the smallest print on the screen. 15 / 14 / 13 at 600 / 500 / 400 now.

**One colour, both modes, on one line.** It was two stacked seven-row tables, 28 inputs, with the
light and dark value of the same token some 500px apart and another table in between.

**A short answer sits beside its question** — ten settings stop spending three stacked rows to say
"10". The hints lean rather than dim, because dimmer is not available: `#737373` on a white card
measures 4.74:1 against the 4.5:1 floor a 13px line has to clear, and the next step on the neutral
scale is 2.58:1. Ten of them are also shorter, cut at sentence boundaries with every language's tail
compared first — Japanese splits one differently and needed two sentences taken, not one. Seven were
left alone because their last sentence is the trap the reader needs.

**Columns were re-measured**, which `admin-design.md` asks for and nobody had done. The Site tab's
right column stood empty for 1,110px; it is 391 now, Reading 459 → 232, Appearance 768 → 225,
Connections 511 → 307.

### Ten fields that were not the kit's field

`kit.tsx` owns the admin's form control, and ten settings fields had each drawn their own: no
min-height, so 38px beside a 40px button on three cards; `rounded-lg` against the kit's `rounded-md`;
`px-3` against `px-3.5`; a focus border with no ring; and no placeholder shade, which mattered most
on the three key forms whose label *is* the placeholder. The ten also disagreed among themselves four
ways, one of them a whole type size. `check:admin-kit` missed all ten because it looked for the ring,
and a rewrite is not a copy — it fails on the idea now, the third such rule, verified by
reintroducing a violation and watching it fail.

**Enrolment held a plaintext TOTP secret and a set of recovery codes for the life of the process.**
Both maps were emptied only where enrolment *succeeds*, so anyone who opened the screen and walked
away left theirs behind, outliving by an unbounded margin the ticket they could only ever be used
with. Dropped on every write now.

Four more shapes that existed twice went the same way, including the libraries' selection bar —
neither copy of which had the tap-target rule, so the two controls that *delete* had a 16px hit box.

### Documents that stopped being true, and a repository that stopped quoting its owner

**Sixty transcribed sentences came out of the tree** — code comments, CSS, tests, five documentation
files, six ADRs and this changelog. A quoted chat message reads differently once it is framed inside
a technical document that strangers read, and it asks the wrong thing of the argument: a rule holds
because of the evidence under it, not because of who said it. Every reason survives, restated as the
fact or the measurement it was evidence for. `CLAUDE.md` carries the rule now.

**Four docs still pointed at the retired Next.js tree**, which `CLAUDE.md`'s own danger note warns
about — `docs/mcp.md` sent a reader to four modules that were deleted with that tree, and said the
OAuth flow is gated by an auth library that no longer exists. Every backticked path in every doc was
then checked: seven do not exist, six of those correctly, and the seventh was live and wrong.

**An audit of `docs/decisions/` against the running code**: four ADRs stated something the code now
contradicts, six index rows were less current than the files they point at, and two decisions had no
ADR at all. No ADR body is edited — the directory is append-only and the index is the part its own
rules say to keep current. ADR 0002 gets the longest note, because it is the one most likely to be
cited wrongly: it reasons from *there are no third-party self-hosters* and *nobody depends on it*, and
there are now releases, a Docker image, eleven translations and a counted install base.

**Sixty long comment blocks say the same things in fewer lines**, from 57 down to 20, across scripts,
the renderer, the admin and the reader's islands. The test was: keep the rule, the measurement that is
the reason to believe it, and the warning about what breaks if somebody undoes it — drop the retelling.
No code moved, and that is proven rather than asserted: every tracked `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.css` file was
stripped of comments before and after and compared line for line, 0 of 590 differ. Three doc comments
in `web/layout.ts` turned out to be stacked above the wrong functions, which git shows was not
introduced by the pass.

**The two READMEs read like somebody wrote them.** Measured before touching them: 386 lines, 5,300
words, 60 em-dashes, 39 paragraphs opening on a bolded stub, and three sections spending 1,737 words
answering one question between them. English openings 1,510 → 1,224 words and 22 em-dashes → none;
the Vietnamese, which is the one its owner reads, 61 em-dashes → 25, written in Vietnamese rather than
carried across sentence by sentence. The version blurb came out — thirteen lines of changelog copied
into a README, stale the day it ships. `docs/features/*` and `docs/conventions/*` were deliberately
left: they are parts catalogues, not prose, and turning them into flowing sentences would make them
longer and easier to drop a fact from.

### Smaller things

- The tour needs a private Chrome profile before it will open its debugging port. Chrome 136+ silently
  ignores the remote-debugging switches on the default profile, which is why the tour passed on every
  dev machine and died on its first CI run.
- Two tour flows picked "a post" by URL shape off the sitemap and picked `/archive` the day the sitemap
  learned to list it. They read the feed now: an item is a post by definition.
- The words run under a small thumbnail instead of leaving a hole beside it — it floats rather than
  holding a grid column for the whole row.
- A broken database at boot prints something a NAS owner can act on, then exits non-zero.
- `scripts/ops/quire-uptime.sh`: the fleet's first uptime watch, same shape as the backup script.
- `check:docs` pins the version everywhere it is written to `package.json`. The number has shipped
  inconsistent three times.

## 2026-08-29 — Quire Ink 2.2.2

The number is the owner's again, and again it is a patch. Under plain semver the picture
frames alone would be a minor, and the admin pass touched eighteen screens — but the shelf
stays stocked, which is the rule at work rather than an exception to it. Two days of work,
twenty-eight commits, and the shape of it is unusual: almost nothing here came from a test
going red. The owner looked at his own screen and said the admin felt *máy móc* — mechanical
— and most of this release is what that sentence turned out to mean once it was measured.

### Pictures get a frame, and galleries get a phone

**A picture can wear a mat.** Paper or ink, in three weights, set per picture with `#frame`
in the URL or site-wide in Settings so three hundred pictures are one decision. The mat is
drawn on the `<img>` itself rather than on a wrapper, so it costs no extra element, no markup
change and no migration; a framed picture is exactly as wide as an unframed one, so nothing
below it moves. The ink mat inverts itself — near-black on a light palette, near-white on a
dark one, across every palette a reader can switch to, from one declaration. Because a
default now exists, `#noframe` exists too: on a framed site, *this one, plain* is a thing an
author has to be able to say.

The default travels as CSS and never as markup. A rendered body is cached under a hash of its
input, so a default that rewrote HTML would leave every already-rendered post wearing the old
frame until something unrelated evicted it. Through variables the change lands on the next
paint, everywhere, with nothing re-rendered — which is why the screen needs no *apply to
existing posts* button.

**A gallery finally reflows.** Not one media query in the product had ever touched
`.gallery`: the column count came from how many pictures were in the run and never from how
wide the screen was, so at 390px a run of ten drew tiles 80 pixels across. A photograph 80
pixels wide is not a photograph, and the lightbox behind it does not save it — nobody taps
what they cannot make out. Two columns below 639px now, about 167px each.

**Every picture had been promising the browser the wrong width.** `sizes` claimed the full
column for every shape, which is true of a picture that holds the column and false of a
floated third, a wide plate and a gallery tile — so a 167px tile was fetching the file cut
for a 672px slot. Each shape states its own now, and **512 joins 1024/1600**: measured over
eighteen pictures, 1,198 KB against 365 KB, about **70% fewer bytes for what a phone actually
draws**, at roughly 8% more stored.

That last part could not ship as a flag. A `<picture>` has no fallback — a candidate that
404s fails the image rather than dropping to the `<img>` — so on the day a third width
shipped, every already-finalised image in every install would have named a file nobody had
generated. `media.variants` is a version now (0 none, 1 the old pair, 2 with 512), the
renderer offers only what an original actually has, and the ordinary hourly sweep upgrades old
images with no re-upload and nothing for an owner to run.

**Two editor faults went with it.** The editor drew a flat three-across gallery while the page
drew two, three or four by count, so four pictures read 3+1 while you wrote and 2×2 once you
published. And **pasting a picture did nothing at all** — the handler read `text/plain`, found
no video URL, and handed a screenshot back to an editor that has no parse rule for a file, so
it vanished without a message. It is the commonest way anybody puts a picture in a post; it
uploads now, exactly as a drop does.

### The admin, measured instead of admired

The admin was reported as reading mechanical. It turned out to be four measurable things.

**Nothing on screen said where you were.** The section you were in and a field's current value
wore the same black pill, the same size, the same weight, eight lines apart. The highlighter
now does the job it does on paper: it marks the line you are on — the rail's current row and
the active tab, and never a value you selected, because a choice is not a place.

**Ninety-two kinds of control changed colour on hover with no transition at all**, snapping
while their neighbours eased. One zero-specificity rule now gives every interactive element in
the shell a 150ms colour transition — never `all`, because transitioning layout is how a list
starts sliding about when a row is added. Afterwards: no control without one, and one duration
across 679 of them instead of two.

**Nineteen rows had controls four pixels or more apart in height**, ten of them the palette
editor's hex field against the swatch beside it. The rule — *a field is as tall as the button
beside it* — was already written down and had never been enforced. The settings search sat
eight pixels above its own tab strip for the same kind of reason: a vertical-stacking token
worn in a horizontal row, pushing the field up by half of itself.

**Four radius values were in use where the rule names three.** Tailwind's bare `rounded` is
4px and is not a step in this hierarchy; it was on 108 chips, badges, code spans and
thumbnails. Three screens had hand-rolled their own chooser with no radius at all — three
copies of the same fifteen lines — sitting directly above kit components doing the same job
properly, which is why the eye caught them.

**A second ink arrives, and it is the one you strike things out with.** The red ballpoint from
the wordmark now dresses the actions that destroy something and nothing else. Trash had drawn
*Restore* and *Delete permanently* side by side in identical grey, with nothing on the row
saying which of the two cannot be undone. `danger` stays outlined rather than filled, and
fills only on hover: the loudest thing on a screen should be the thing you came to do, not the
thing that destroys work.

### The admin on the screens people actually hold it on

Audited at seven widths across twelve screens — 344 (a Galaxy Z Fold shut), 360, 390, 412 (a
Z Flip open), 673 (a Z Fold open, upright), 768 and 841 (the same, turned) — for three faults:
anything past the viewport, anything clipped by an ancestor that hides overflow, and any hit
area under a fingertip. **Eight screens overflowed, twenty-four controls were clipped,
twenty-six kinds of control were under 32px.** Now zero, two and twenty-three — and the two
are a scroll container doing its job.

**Five of the eight Settings tabs could not be reached by a finger.** The strip was
`overflow-hidden`, and a hidden box is a scroll container that script and focus can move and a
person cannot: at 390px, Appearance, Search & URLs, Connections, AI and System sat past the
edge, reachable only by typing a `?tab=` URL.

**The Settings columns would not shrink**, so the Layout tab pushed the page 160px sideways at
344px and carried the fixed Save bar off the edge — the primary action of the screen, half off
a phone.

**Unfolding a phone made the admin worse.** The rail appeared at 768px and cost 208 of them: a
Z Fold open and upright is 673px and gave the form all of it, while turned to landscape at
841px the rail arrived and left the form 633. A 768px tablet fared worst at 560 — less room
than the same device had while folded shut. The admin is forms and tables, so content width is
the product: the rail waits for 1024 now, and **between 1024 and 1279 it arrives already shut**
— 72px of icons rather than 208px of words, handing the form back 136px on exactly the screens
that sit in that band. The band forces it and never saves that, because a window that happens
to be 1100px wide is not the owner stating a preference; leaving the band restores their own
choice untouched.

### Six holes the tests could not see

Every one of these passed 1,954 tests and sixty-one browser flows, because a test asks whether
the code does what it says and none of them lies about itself.

- **The print sheet had been written against an essay**, and an essay carries no listing cards.
  A card fades in on a view() timeline whose progress on paper is whatever it was on screen —
  zero, for everything below the fold. On the front page, five of ten cards printed at opacity
  0 and two more part way, all still taking their space: two posts and a wall of white over
  three sheets.
- **Twenty-six switches had no name.** `role=switch` and `aria-checked` were both present; the
  word for *what* was being switched was not, because the row's label is a sibling of the
  button and a sibling names nothing. Every toggle in Settings announced itself as "switch,
  on". The prop is required now, so the next one cannot be added without a name.
- **The Publish button sat off the right-hand edge** of a 390px phone when editing an existing
  post — 584px of row in a 390px window, reachable only by scrolling the admin sideways.
- **Three outbound fetches had no clock**, and all three take a URL somebody else chose. There
  is one 15-second ceiling covering a whole redirect chain now, and 10 seconds each on
  Turnstile and the Google token exchange, where a reader is sitting on the request while it
  runs.
- **The logo render read whatever arrived**, uncapped, though every other byte path that starts
  from a typed URL is capped while reading.
- **A nine-pixel target removed a subscriber.**

### The layout stops jumping on Android

Every text family already declared a metric-matched twin, so the `font-display: swap` window
changes glyphs without moving a line break. It worked — on a Mac. The twins were Georgia and
Arial, and **Android has neither**, so `local()` missed, the adjustment never applied, and the
mechanism that exists to hold the layout still did nothing at all. Measured on the demo's front
page at 390px: during the swap the document stood 6,390px tall against 6,921px once the real
face landed, so **every block below the first sat half a screen too high and then dropped**.
The owner had reported it as "text first, then the layout arrives"; it is invisible on a Mac,
which is how it survived two months and a table written specifically to prevent it.

There is a second twin per family now, on Android's own faces — Noto Serif for the serif
stacks, Roboto for the sans — each with its own measured numbers, because one `size-adjust`
cannot describe two local faces of different width. Cost: 306 bytes of CSS per page, before
compression.

### An admin tab open during an update stops breaking

Opening Trash on a tab that had been sitting there since before a deploy produced the crash
sheet: every chunk filename carries a content hash, so the build that tab was holding named a
file the new build had deleted. The screens already visited kept working; the next one touched
could not load. This is not a demo problem — every self-hosted blog updates its own instance,
and anyone with the admin open when it does is in exactly that state. The one error whose cure
is known now reloads once, guarded by a mark in `sessionStorage` so a build genuinely missing a
file cannot spin the tab forever.

**And the loading bar stopped drawing itself twice.** The owner said it sometimes ran two or
three times; counting insertions found nothing, because the bar was not being replaced. It
marked itself finished inside every cold load and then un-marked itself, replaying the whole
animation, at the seam where the shell answers and the page then asks for its own data. That
seam is 400ms and is spent once, on the first run; charging every later click that wait would
leave the bar on screen after the page was ready, which is the opposite complaint.

### The admin's small print rejoins its own scale

12px text in the admin sat at 2.58:1 against light and 3.78:1 against dark, either side of the
4.5:1 a line that size has to clear — the context line under every comment, every timestamp,
the table heads, and Light / Clear cache / Sign out at the foot of the sidebar. The public site
passed in both themes and always had; this was only ever the owner's screen, which is to say
the screen somebody sits in front of every day.

It was never a new opinion about grey. The scale had held the right pair the whole time, and
117 places had drifted off it three ways: 55 wore the pair backwards, 30 had a bare light value
with no dark half, and 32 had a bare dark-side value with no light half — because a colour with
no `dark:` variant does not stop existing when the theme flips. Placeholder text and disabled
states were left alone: both *mean* lighter than what you type.

### The pen's marks become the logo

The old icon said Qi in a terminal's voice on a black square, and nothing about it wrote. The
new one is the product performing on one glyph: a Literata Q with the highlighter swept behind
it, the red ballpoint ring around it, the graphite underline beneath it, and a full stop in
ink — every pigment the pen's own, taken from the code that draws it, in light and dark values
both. The letterforms are outlines, so no file depends on a font being installed, and the 16px
favicon cut is simplified because all four marks at that size read as a smudge. The admin and
the sign-in door carry it now, and the collapsed rail wears Q with the red stop.

### Where this thing can live

The install section had been organised by method and never answered the reader's first
question, which is *where*. A four-line map opens it now — a rented VPS, a DigitalOcean
droplet, a NAS, any Docker host — and each has a page rather than a footnote:

- **DigitalOcean**: one paste of cloud-init user data on the droplet-create page. Docker, the
  published image on bind mounts, `SITE_URL` from the machine's own default route, and the
  claim link fished out into a file so the first lesson is not `docker logs`. Deliberately a
  droplet and not App Platform, whose ephemeral filesystem would erase the blog on every
  redeploy.
- **Unraid**: live in Community Applications, so the instruction is four words — search
  QuireInk in Apps.
- **Synology** DSM 7.2 and **QNAP** take the compose file directly in Container Manager and
  Container Station, with no shell at any point.
- **Runtipi** gets a straight answer instead of a search that will never find anything: the
  official store is closed to new apps, so *Add custom app* and paste.

**The blog claims its own name in the official MCP registry** — `com.quireink/blog`, the
reverse-DNS namespace the project already owns rather than a personal handle, because the name
outlives whoever holds the account.

### The image gets smaller, and keeps what it must carry

**308 MB to 263 MB on disk, 95 MB to about 81 MB to pull.** Two of three ideas paid: sharp's
musl binaries, which a glibc image could not load if it tried (19 MB), and what the server
never opens — source maps, `.d.ts` declarations and prose (26 MB). The third is recorded as
dead because it will occur to somebody again: swapping the Bun base for a plain Debian plus a
copied binary saves nothing, since 180 of those 184 MB are the two things we need.

**And then the prune had to give something back.** `-iname '*.md'` cannot tell a README from a
copyright notice, and eight packages in the production tree carry theirs only as `LICENSE.md`
— jose, qs, ms, express-rate-limit, @img/colour, @shikijs/vscode-textmate, css-to-react-native
and json-schema-typed. MIT, BSD-2 and BSD-3 all require that notice to travel with every copy,
and an image on two public registries is a copy handed to strangers. All 42 licence files in
the tree are kept now, for 172 KB against the 28 MB the prune still wins.

### Documents that had stopped being true

- **Both READMEs were carrying 2.0.x speed measurements.** They are re-measured, the feature
  table finally seats Comments — a whole subsystem with its own spam gate the page had never
  listed — and three Vietnamese env rows that had never been translated now are. The
  Vietnamese `SITE_URL` row had been describing the exact behaviour the software deliberately
  refuses.
- **The font-preload table said NEVER where the code said always**, citing the table for a
  measurement that had moved. Whichever a reader trusted, the other was wrong, and the bad
  failure mode was the likely one: somebody tidying the code back into line with the doc would
  have undone a measured change.
- **The stylesheet header claimed to be inlined into every page.** It has not been since
  2026-07-30. Re-measured rather than merely corrected, on a throttled phone: linked wins by
  44ms, because the preload scanner starts the stylesheet while the HTML is still streaming
  while the extra 45 KB in the document costs real time. Inlining is the intuitive optimisation
  here and it is a regression.
- **One account's design tooling and one live domain left the public repository.** Three
  comments had cited a second live site by name while making a point that did not need it; the
  measurements stay, only the domain goes.

## 2026-08-27 — Quire Ink 2.2.1

The number is the owner's, per the rule in `releases.md`: under plain semver the languages
alone would have made this a minor, and he chose to keep the shelf stocked.

### The interface speaks eleven languages

Five new languages, picked for where the writing communities live: **Français, Español,
Português (Brasil), Italiano and Русский** join English, Tiếng Việt, Deutsch, 日本語,
简体中文 and 한국어 — about 970 strings each, reader-facing and admin, each written in its
own software register (French says *vous*, Spanish and Italian *tú*/*tu*, Brazilian
Portuguese *você*, Russian *вы*). Readers still pay nothing for any of it: their strings are
rendered on the server, and the admin dictionaries load only for the owner.

**The translations moved from `src/locales/` to `locales/` at the repository root**, so a
translator finds them without learning the tree, and both READMEs now have a Translations
section saying plainly that community translations are welcome — one file per language, and
the compiler's every-key-in-every-language guarantee is what makes a half-finished
contribution unshippable rather than half-shipped.

**Every old translation got an editor's pass** — the review none of them had had since
arriving. Thirty-two real fixes. German was the worst: ASCII umlauts where ä and ü
belonged, and du/Sie mixed in both directions — the admin now consistently says *Sie*,
reader-facing strings consistently *du*, and that split is documented as deliberate.
Chinese dropped 您 for 你. Vietnamese had one string addressing every owner as *anh*.
Japanese normalised its エディター/ブラウザー long vowels.

Russian earned three product fixes on the way in. **A Russian title used to slug to
nothing** and fall back to a timestamp URL — slugify now transliterates Cyrillic (CJK keeps
its deliberate timestamp fallback). **A Russian post got no share card at all** — the OG
guard only recognised Latin scripts; the card renderer now carries a Cyrillic Inter subset
and draws Русский as well as it draws English. And the font preloader stops preloading
Latin subsets a Russian page will not use.

**Setup asks the language first now.** It is the opening question of the site step, and
answering it re-renders the step in the language just picked, so the rest of setup is read
in the owner's own words.

### The snapshot leaves the machine

[ADR 0035](docs/decisions/0035-the-snapshot-leaves-the-machine.md). Every archive the
schedule or the Back up button writes is also PUT into any S3-compatible bucket — **R2, S3,
MinIO: one protocol**, Bun's own client, no new dependency — and the remote copies are
pruned to the same keep-count, touching only this blog's prefix and name shape so a shared
bucket keeps whatever else it holds. What the usual Drive integration gets wrong is not
repeated here: no OAuth, no state table, no in-app restore theatre; a failed upload logs
`backup.offsite` and never fails the backup itself. Four pasted values in Settings → System
(with env fallbacks for a fleet), and a **Test the bucket** button that writes and deletes
one marker while the owner is still at the keyboard. Proven twice in the suite: a fake
bucket for the pruning discipline, and a real S3 wire against a live stub server for the
seams a fake bypasses.

### The import finishes the move

[ADR 0034](docs/decisions/0034-the-import-finishes-the-move.md). Two gaps the comparison
page used to admit in public are now the software's job. **The old URLs**: a published
WordPress item's path and a Substack `/p/` path become 301s at import time, in the owner's
own redirects table, refused when they would shadow live content. **The images**: the
importer re-reads what it wrote, asks "what is still remote?", fetches in batches of five
through the SSRF guard and the upload caps, stores the files in the media library and
rewrites every reference. The admin loops it after an upload with a live count on the
button; the `import_images` MCP tool is the same loop for an agent. Stateless by rescan — a
crash loses nothing, and a blog imported last month can be brought home today.

### Nothing here needs a Cloudflare account

Three ADRs with one question behind them: install this and it works, with no account
anywhere in the path.

- **The blog winds its own clock**
  ([ADR 0031](docs/decisions/0031-the-blog-winds-its-own-clock.md)). The process had no
  timers at all — an assumption inherited from a platform that could not keep one. It now
  runs its own ticks: due posts every minute, housekeeping hourly. The failure this removes
  is worse than "a scheduled post is late": with no sweep, the cached front page and feed
  kept serving the world a version without the post **while the admin showed it published**.
  `CRON_INTERNAL=0` hands the job to an external scheduler and `/api/cron` is unchanged.
  Two minutes after boot the log says once what the first sweep did, so a running clock and
  a stopped one no longer look identical from outside.
- **The comment gate is its own**
  ([ADR 0032](docs/decisions/0032-the-comment-gate-needs-no-account.md)). The only real
  spam gate used to be Turnstile — a Cloudflare account, and ~60 KB fetched from a third
  party on every page with a form, on a product whose claim is no third-party request
  anywhere. The blog now signs its own challenge into the page; the reader's browser solves
  it quietly while they type; sending spends it. 761 bytes, no account, no server state
  beyond spent salts. Turnstile still takes over whenever its keys are set, and Settings
  says which gate is standing.
- **Purging an edge that is not Cloudflare**
  ([ADR 0033](docs/decisions/0033-purging-an-edge-that-is-not-cloudflare.md)). One webhook
  URL beside the Cloudflare pair, POSTed to on every cache flush — Bunny, Fastly and a
  script in front of nginx differ in the URL and agree on answering a POST.
- **HTTPS in one command.** `docker-compose.caddy.yml` + a Caddyfile: the blog and Caddy
  together, the same security headers as the documented nginx block, certificate and
  renewal included.

### Reading

- **Read next.** Every post now ends with one pointer forward — the next part of its
  series, else the adjacent post. A text block in the page's own type, not a widget.
- **Resume.** The blog keeps the reader's place in *their* browser and offers it back as
  one quiet pill that withdraws the moment they scroll; finishing a post forgets it.
  Nothing is sent anywhere.
- **Book mode's size control is plain type.** A small *a* and a large *A* on one baseline —
  no pill, no divider. The "black seam" the pill wore on first open was `showModal()`'s
  focus ring squeezed through its overflow; initial focus lands on the page itself now. The
  chosen size is remembered per browser. The running head also learned to reserve twice the
  control-box width it had been reserving — it is centred, so half of any allowance runs to the
  right — measured at three widths with the title that broke it.

### The repository teaches the agent

Three Agent Skills ship in `.claude/skills/` — installing, working a live blog over MCP,
and moving one in from WordPress, Ghost, Substack or Medium — so an assistant that has just
cloned the repository knows the job instead of inferring it from four hundred lines of
prose. `install.sh` is the README's install path as one command: clone, install, build,
start, and the claim link in the log; deliberately none of the half with consequences (no
sudo, no systemd, and it refuses root).

### Smaller things

- **The Docker image had stopped building** the day the translations moved to the
  repository root: both Dockerfile stages copy named paths, and neither named the new
  folder. CI's image job caught it; both stages copy `locales/` now. The same move was
  taught to the deploy tooling the same day it happened — the image was the copy that
  lagged.
- **All six README plates are reshot against this release** — book mode shows its new
  chrome, the setup plate shows the language question first — and the sixth plate joined
  `scripts/ops/shoot-readme.sh`, so every picture in the README now regenerates from one
  command.
- **The log says once that the clock is running.** Two minutes in, the first sweep prints
  what it did and then stays quiet — a line an hour for years is how a log stops being read.

## 2026-08-25 — Quire Ink 2.2.0

### The install guide taught a step the software had stopped taking

Setting a blog up moved into the browser earlier the same day, and exactly one file learned
it: the self-hosting guide. **The README — which this repository's own rules call the
canonical install doc — still opened a terminal**, and so did `docker-compose.yml`, the
Docker page, the Docker Hub overview and the install guide on quireink.com. Those are the
files the feature was built for: the people on a NAS, a PaaS or somebody else's Docker host,
who are the ones reading them.

They now read the log. Every route says the same thing, and none of them needs `docker exec`
or an interactive terminal — the CLI is named at the end of each as the alternative it now is.

Worse than stale: **quireink.com told people the command prints their TOTP secret and ten
recovery codes.** It prints neither, and has not since two-factor moved to the browser at
first sign-in. Anybody following it saw a bare `created` and had every reason to think it had
half-failed. The structured data Google reads carried the same claim. And the page's advice
for a reader who had lost their recovery codes was to *"make a second owner account"* — which
the software refuses to do, by design, so the instruction could only ever end in an error.

### Smaller things

- **The first line of every log said `quire 2.0`.** A literal, carried from the rewrite
  through every release since, in the line an operator quotes in a bug report — and since
  this morning it sits directly above the setup link that the Docker and NAS instructions
  send people to `docker logs` for, where a wrong number reads as the version they just
  installed. It reads the real one now, the way the dashboard and the update check already do.
- **The language select was 2.5px shorter than the three inputs beside it.** The pass that
  rebuilt it compared border, radius, padding, font and background — all identical — and did
  not compare height. The lever is not `line-height`: **Chrome forces `line-height:normal` on
  a select and ignores the declaration even inline with `!important`**, measured rather than
  assumed. It is a `min-height` restating the input's own box, so the two move together when a
  token moves.
- **`bun run tour` had never seen an image.** The seeder wrote the twenty-one seeded pictures
  to the repository's own `uploads/` while the tour's server was told to serve its throwaway
  one, so every picture on every toured page 404'd — and all sixty flows passed anyway,
  because none of them asserts that an image loads. The same blindness reached the backup
  check standing next to it: it was proving that a 260 KB archive of twelve files restored
  byte-identically. It now proves it for 54 files and 3.9 MB, images included.
- **Four links pointed at a section number that no longer exists**, after the Docker section
  left the self-hosting guide and stopped being numbered — including the guide's own two
  references to itself. A link checker over all 79 markdown files found two more: a
  `#-run-locally-dev` anchor in `CONTRIBUTING.md` naming a heading that has never existed
  under that name, and a Vietnamese README still pointing into a file the Docker section had
  moved out of.
- **The admin documentation said Settings has seven tabs.** It has had eight since the AI tab
  arrived. The assistant that now lives in the admin had no entry in the admin feature doc at
  all, and neither the print stylesheet nor Copy quote had one in the reading doc; all three
  are written up now.
- **The README grew a picture of setup** — the three screens after the log line, side by side.
- **ADR 0007's flat "mandatory" two-factor is amended** by
  [ADR 0030](docs/decisions/0030-two-factor-can-wait-until-there-is-an-address.md), which
  writes down the one exception the code has carried since this morning, why it opens nothing
  that was shut, and why it closes itself. The house rule is that loosening a rule edits the
  rule in the same commit; this is that debt paid.

### Setting up a blog no longer needs a terminal

Everything after the account was already in the browser — the QR code, the recovery codes —
and the account itself was a shell command. That one step is where a person on a NAS, on a
PaaS, or on somebody else's Docker host gave up.

Now every start of an unclaimed blog prints the link that claims it:

```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  This blog has no owner yet. Open the link below to claim it.           │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  https://example.com/setup?token=…
```

Open it and the rest is a browser: username, email, password, then straight into two-factor
without being asked for that password a second time.

**The shell was never an oversight — it was the proof**, and the proof is kept. Whoever can
read the log has the machine, so the account they make is theirs by definition. A plain
"create the owner" page on the open web throws that away: between `docker compose up` and the
owner typing a password there is a window, and whoever finds the URL first owns the blog. The
token lives in memory only, so a restart mints a new one and the old line in the log stops
being a secret. `/setup` answers 404 the moment an account exists.

And a browser visitor to an unclaimed blog is finally told so. Before this, a fresh install
answered a sign-in form for an account that could not exist — indistinguishable from having
forgotten the password to a blog you never made.

### And then the two questions worth interrupting somebody for

Setup does not end at the account. Two more screens, and the list of what is NOT on them is
the design: palettes, fonts, book mode and the feature switches are all absent, because
nobody can judge them before the site has a single post on it. Asking is asking a person to
pick the binding for a book they have not written, and a choice made blind is worse than a
default — a default still reads as "not decided yet", while something you clicked reads as
decided. Those stay on the dashboard's re-openable first-five-minutes card, which is the
right shape for them.

What is left earns its place on one of two grounds. **The site address and the time zone are
wrong by default and silent about it**: one makes every feed, sitemap, share card and
newsletter link say `localhost:3000`, the other makes every date on the site read in the
server's timezone rather than yours. The browser knows both, so both arrive filled in — the
address from the one you are standing on, the zone from `Intl`. **And the front page** is the
one honest coin-flip, because it decides what `/` even is; it is SHOWN as two small drawings
rather than described, since a sentence is the wrong medium for a choice about a look.

The last screen ends in the editor, not the dashboard. The first post is the reason anybody
installed this.

### "Set this up later", but only where later is honest

Two-factor stays mandatory ([ADR 0007](docs/decisions/0007-self-hosted-password-totp-auth.md)),
with one opening: while a blog has **no public address**, the enrolment screen offers a way
past it. The reasoning is narrow on purpose. Before anyone has enrolled, two-factor protects
nothing — whoever reaches that screen with the password enrols their own authenticator — so
skipping on a laptop you are trying the software on widens no door that was shut. Setting an
address takes the offer away, and because nothing is written, the next sign-in asks for
enrolment again. Later keeps meaning later.

The route refuses on its own, not just when the button is missing: a button that is not
rendered is not a check.

### Smaller things

- **Two fields wore the browser's default border** beside their filled siblings, one after
  the other, because the sign-in stylesheet named input types one by one and each new type
  was invisible until somebody opened the page. It excludes the checkbox instead, which says
  the same thing and stays true. The language select was rebuilt on the same numbers as the
  inputs rather than its own rounded ones: four fields in a column, one almost right, reads
  as a mistake rather than a choice.
- **The newspaper drawing rendered as a grey slab.** Its three columns lost the flex row to a
  more specific rule above them and stacked, each as wide as the card. Found by measuring the
  boxes, not by looking: 118x21 apiece inside a card 110px wide.
- **The tour refused to start when nothing was running.** Its port check matched *any* socket
  touching 3399, including a browser's own closed connections to a dev server already stopped
  — so it reported the port busy and sent whoever read it hunting for a server that was not
  there. It looks for a listener now.
- The self-hosting guide's account section described a CLI that had stopped printing the TOTP
  secret and the recovery codes. It now leads with the setup link, and says where the codes
  really appear.

### The maintenance tick can finish, and says so when it cannot

`/api/cron` is the one route this software tells every operator to schedule, and the one
route that can legitimately run for minutes: it encodes image variants with sharp. `Bun.serve`
closes a request that has produced nothing for its **default ten seconds**, and that default
was nowhere in this repository. A tick sweeping a backlog was cut off mid-encode and answered
`curl: (52) Empty reply from server` — which reads like a dead process rather than a working
one being interrupted, and left the rest of the backlog looking like a bug that was never
there.

Two changes, and the first is the real one. The sweep now bounds itself by **time** rather
than by count: it stops after six seconds and leaves the rest for the next tick, which is
idempotent by construction. A count would need tuning per box and per image size; a deadline
tunes itself. And `idleTimeout` is now stated out loud in `src/index.ts` at 120 seconds, so a
backup export or a large range request is not racing a number nobody chose.

### A Permissions-Policy, and a short one on purpose

Every feature named in it is one nothing here asks for and no proxy in front would want to
allow more of: camera, microphone, geolocation, payment, USB, MIDI, the motion sensors, and
Chrome's Topics API. What is **absent** matters as much. `fullscreen`, `autoplay`,
`picture-in-picture` and `clipboard-write` are left at their defaults, because a browser
combines policies by taking the most restrictive — naming `fullscreen` here would quietly
take the fullscreen button off an owner's embedded YouTube player, and naming
`clipboard-write` would break the copy button on every code block.

The recommended nginx block in the self-hosting guide stops repeating the three headers the
application already sends. It was telling operators to send each one twice.

### Small things

- **An `apple-touch-icon`**, which was the only thing missing from the icon set: nothing else
  on the page points iOS at the site's own mark, and Safari has only read manifest icons
  since 16.4. `rel="icon"` stays conditional deliberately — `/favicon.ico` is the path a
  browser asks for anyway, so naming it repeats what was going to happen.
- **The import button said "WordPress export (.xml)"** while the file input beside it accepted
  four formats and the help text described all four. It names them now.

### The Auto schema switch does something now

It shipped in the settings shape, defaulted to ON, and told the owner in plain words that it
"adds structured data for Google: WebSite on the home page, BlogPosting on each post". Nothing
read it. `grep -rn 'ld+json' src/` returned nothing at all. The docs recorded the gap honestly;
the switch in front of the owner did not, so it read as a feature that was working.

It is wired. **`WebSite`** on the home page, carrying the sitelinks search box only when search
is actually switched on — describing an endpoint that answers 404 is worse than describing
none. **`BlogPosting`** on each post, with the real `dateModified` and only when the post was
genuinely saved again, so nothing claims to have been edited on the day it appeared. A static
page gets none: an object restating the title and the canonical tells a crawler nothing the
tags beside it already did. No author, because there is no owner-name setting in this
software and the only name on record is the sign-in username; the site is named as publisher
instead. And no schema at all when `siteUrl` is unset — the same rule the canonical follows,
because `http://localhost:3000` has reached production in a feed and a sitemap before.

### Every listing describes itself

Search, every tag, every category, every series and the 404 page all shipped **the same meta
description**: the site's own one-line summary, which describes none of them. Four indexable
page kinds, one identical snippet. Term and series pages now build their own from the six
locales, and the 404 and search pages use the sentences already on them. The home page keeps
the site description, because there it is the right answer.

### A search results page is no longer an invitation to a crawler

`/search?q=` mints a URL per query and carried no canonical and nothing else to stop an
indexer either. It sends `noindex, follow` now — follow, because the links on that page are
the real posts and there is no reason to waste them.

### Three repairs a screen reader notices, and a description that fits in the result

Found by auditing the rendered pages against the [Front-End Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io)
(387 rules), not by reading the source — which is why they had survived this long.

**Every navigation region says which one it is.** A page carried two or three `<nav>`
landmarks and a screen reader lists them by label alone, so they all read as "navigation"
and none of them told you which. The contents rail already got this right; the sidebar menu
and the pager now do too. The header's control cluster went the other way: search, theme,
palette, grid, subscribe and the drawer toggle are buttons, not links to anywhere, so
announcing them as a navigation landmark sent people to a toolbar. It is a `<div>` now.
Nothing moved on screen — the class carried all the styling.

**A table header says it is one.** Every `<th>` a Markdown table produces now carries
`scope="col"`. In a simple table a screen reader can infer the column from position; `scope`
is what WCAG asks for by name, and in a table with merged cells it is the only association
there is. This is the second deliberate divergence from what 1.x printed, recorded in
`golden/` the way the first one was: 1.x's answer stays untouched on disk, the new answer
sits beside it, and eleven changed lines across five fixtures were checked one by one to
differ by that attribute and nothing else.

**Meta descriptions stopped being written past the point anybody reads them.** The bound was
200 characters under a comment saying a search engine truncates there, while a second comment
eleven lines below said the wall is about 160. The second one was right: five of ten sampled
pages shipped a description with a tail that Google cuts off. It is 157 now — 160 less the
ellipsis that says it was cut — and the two comments agree.

### An agent can now read the blog, not just write it

Six new MCP tools — the reading half of the surface: `get_traffic` (the dashboard's own
numbers, with the window before for comparison), `get_audience` (subscriber and comment
counts), `list_comments` and `delete_comment` (moderation, soft delete into the Trash),
`search_posts` (the owner's full-text search, drafts included) and `get_update_status`
(the amber/green dot, answerable by an assistant). Two things stay unreachable over MCP
on purpose, held by tests: subscriber addresses, and commenters' emails and IPs. A new
[agent cookbook](./docs/agent-cookbook.md) shows prompts that do real jobs with all this.

### And steward it

Six more: `compose_homepage` curates the composed front page (which rows, what size,
where their posts come from — the layout grammar stays the product's), `update_appearance`
restyles the site strictly from the curated menus (an agent has no eyes, so it gets preset
ids, never a color), `get_post_traffic` answers for one post, `reply_comment` answers a
reader under the owner's name and emails them like a reply typed on the page,
`send_test_newsletter` sends the next issue to the owner alone — the recipient is not a
parameter, and the real broadcast is deliberately not a tool — and `create_snapshot`
takes the scheduler's own backup before anything big.

### Every picture can have words now

Settings grew an **AI tab** — the model, the jobs it does automatically, and the MCP
door an agent connects through, all in one place. Paste an API key — Anthropic, OpenAI
or Gemini, your pick, your bill — and **the models list themselves** for you to choose
from, which also proves the key works before you save it. From then on every image you
upload gets alt text written for it — and two more jobs joined it, each with its own
switch: a post published with the excerpt left blank gets a real one written in your
tone (the mechanical first-fifty-words was never an excerpt, it was a shrug), and every
comment arriving through the public door is read once — spam moves to the Trash where
you can restore it, and when the model mumbles, the reader wins. The library also grew
a button: describe every image that has never been described, for the blog that just
moved in with five hundred pictures. Each image gets alt text written for it, in the site's own
language, in the background, by the time you go looking. Pasting the key IS the switch:
without one, no request ever leaves your server, which keeps the promise this software
already makes elsewhere. The suggestion lands on the image in the library, flows into the
editor as the default alt when you insert it, and stays yours to edit — clear it and the
machine never refills it, because '' is a decision and NULL is an absence.

### An assistant moved into the admin

The sidebar grew an **Assistant** page: a chat that runs on the model you plugged into
Settings → AI and acts through **exactly the tools an MCP agent gets** — the same
registry, the same limits, the same activity log. "How did the blog do this week?",
"sweep the comments for spam", "switch to the sepia palette" — asked in a sentence,
inside the admin, no MCP client required. Every tool it runs shows as a chip under the
reply, arguments are checked against each tool's own schema before anything executes,
and the conversation lives in your open tab and nowhere else — the blog's database
holds posts, not chats. Two doors now, one rulebook: whoever has a Claude subscription
connects over MCP; whoever plugged in a key talks to the blog directly.

### Three more front doors

The importer used to speak only WordPress. It now takes a Ghost export (.json), a
Substack export or a Medium export (the .zip they email you) through the same one file
input — the server tells the archives apart by structure, because nobody remembers whose
zip is whose. And every import, WordPress included, now passes a deterministic cleanup:
dead shortcodes swept, captions folded into their images, non-breaking-space debris and
blank-line pileups gone. No AI touches your words on the way in; an assistant connected
over MCP can polish further, post by post, through the same revisioned saves as any edit.

### Your essays print like pages, not like web pages

Press Ctrl+P on a post — or save it as a PDF — and you get the essay. Before this there
was not one print rule in the whole stylesheet, so paper got the screen: the reading
progress bar, the [search] [dark] [palette] [menu] buttons, a "book mode" link that does
nothing on paper, then the related posts, the entire comment thread, the subscribe card
and the footer. Ten sheets for a four-page piece, and four dead buttons at the top of it.

Now the page carries the masthead as one line of provenance, the essay, its notes, its
tags — and stops. The measure is set for paper rather than for a viewport, headings do
not sit alone at the foot of a page, tables and code and figures are not cut in half,
code wraps instead of losing its right-hand end, and a link that leaves the site prints
its address so a paper copy is still a lead. Your own type settings come with it, at the
size you chose. A reader printing at night gets ink on paper rather than a black page.
The pen marks are the one thing that keeps its colour, because they are the reason a page
off this site looks like this site.

### Small things

The Assistant page and the AI tab were both rebuilt after being looked at rather than
reasoned about: the tab was drawing browser-default dropdowns and OS-blue checkboxes
beside the switches on the card next to it, and had no labels on any of its three fields;
the chat had its composer stranded two thirds of the way down the page with empty paper
under it, said nothing about which model would answer, and let you type a question before
telling you no model was connected. Both are made from the same kit as every other screen
now, and the assistant names its model, offers a few openers, keeps the composer where
your hands are, and lets you start over.

Two links that went nowhere: `Settings → AI` reached from anywhere outside the settings
screen quietly landed on the Site tab (the tab list the address is checked against had
never been told the AI tab exists — it is read from the source of truth now), and the
Assistant had taken a fifth seat in a sidebar whose rule is four. It sits with the rest
of "everything else", one click away.

### Select a sentence, and take it with you

Highlight anything in a post and one small control appears: **Copy quote**. It puts the
sentence on your clipboard with a link that opens the post *at that sentence*, scrolled to
it and highlighted by the reader's own browser. Paste it into a message and the person on
the other end lands exactly where you were, not at the top of a long essay.

It is not a share button. Nothing is sent anywhere, no account is involved and no third
party is contacted: the link is an ordinary URL with a text fragment on the end, so a
browser that does not know the trick simply opens the post. On a phone it sits *below* the
selection, where the operating system's own Copy menu is not.

The link stays readable, which took some care: the usual way of building one percent-encodes
every non-Latin letter, so a Vietnamese sentence came out as two hundred characters of hex.
Only whitespace and the three characters the syntax reserves are escaped now, and a long
quote is anchored on its two ends rather than carried whole.

### The keyboard under your fingers, and a caret that stops flickering

**Typewriter feedback** was one switch. It is now a choice of instrument in Settings →
Appearance: **Typewriter**, **Mechanical, tactile**, **Mechanical, linear**, or **Off**.
The typewriter strikes bright and hard. The tactile board gives you the bump and then the
bottom-out, twelve milliseconds apart, which is the thing your finger is actually feeling.
The linear one has no bump at all: one soft, low thock. The space bar and the return are
deeper than the letters on all three, because they are the two biggest keys on any board,
and no two strikes are identical — a click repeated exactly stops sounding like typing.
Nothing is downloaded for any of it; the sound is made in the browser, as it always was.

**And the flicker is gone.** Every keystroke used to animate the whole paragraph you were
typing into: its opacity dropped to 0.9 and it moved by half a pixel. At an ordinary typing
speed that is a paragraph strobing five times a second under your eyes. Nothing moves the
text now. The sound carries the keystroke, the caret carries the position, and the words
hold still — which is what a real machine does, where the paper moves and the letters do not.

**The caret stops blinking while you are typing**, and starts again about two thirds of a
second after you stop. It fades rather than switching on and off, and never fades all the
way out. A blink means "the cursor is here and nothing is happening"; while your hands are
moving, something is.

If you had the old switch on, you have the typewriter. If you had it off, you have Off.

### And you set how loud it is

The click shipped at one fixed level, and one level is a guess about a room, a pair of
speakers and a person. **Key volume** sits under the instrument in Settings → Appearance:
drag it, and it plays a key as it goes, so you are listening to the thing you are setting
instead of walking to the editor and back to find out. Picking an instrument plays it too —
tactile and linear are a difference you hear or you do not hear at all.

Nothing about the balance moves with it: a space stays deeper than a letter, and the tactile
bump stays under its bottom-out, wherever you put the slider. **Zero is a real setting** —
the caret without the sound — and it is not the same as turning the instrument Off.

### Three sounds that are actually three sounds

The first attempt was not three instruments. It was one burst of noise through one filter,
three times, at three centre frequencies — which is one sound with three EQ settings, and it
sounded like it. This is a rebuild from the machines outward.

They are called **Woody**, **Crisp** and **Deep**, and they used to be called after the
machines they are modelled on. They are not called that any more, because they are not
recordings and they are not going to fool anybody: a name that promises a 1940s Underwood
makes a good synthesised knock sound worse than it is. So they are named for what you hear.

**Woody** is built like a machine that strikes: a lever, something hitting a hard surface
through a ribbon, and a small bright mechanism finishing the job a moment later — three
events across sixty milliseconds. Its space bar strikes nothing at all, so it is a dull
knock and a tick, and its return key sends the whole thing back across and into the stop.
**Crisp** is a snap and then a landing fourteen milliseconds after it: bright, hard, over in
forty. **Deep** has no snap — a blunt start, a low body letting go slowly, and one quiet
tick as the key comes back up.

Every key has three separate takes, matched in level so they differ in grain and not in
force, and each one plays back a few percent off pitch. Forty keys in a line never repeat.

**And it is much louder.** The top of the slider is about six times the amplitude the old
one reached at ITS top, and the default sits well above where the old one ever went. The
three are levelled against each other by measurement rather than by eye — weighted for what
the ear is sensitive to, and again for what a laptop speaker can actually reproduce — so
switching sound changes the sound and not the volume.

**Play a few keys** now sits beside the volume. Dragging the slider plays one key, which
turns out to be easy to miss; six of them in a row is not, and a run is the only way to hear
what separates these three anyway. If your browser had not yet let a page make a sound, the
first key you asked for used to be swallowed. It is not any more.

Whatever you had chosen stays chosen.

### The pen is yours now

Settings → Appearance grew a card called **The pen**: the five highlighter pigments, the
ring, the underline, and what selected text looks like on a light page and on a dark one.
Every field starts empty, and empty means the ink that is there today, so nothing changes
until you change it and **Reset to default** puts all nine back.

Pick a colour and it brings its own family with it. A highlighter pigment is really four
values: the sweep, the same sweep pre-mixed into a dark page, and two ballpoint-strength
versions for the ring and the underline, because a pale sweep is invisible as a 2px line.
You choose one; the other three are worked out from it, by the same rule the built-in inks
were measured against. If the colour you pick is dark enough to swallow the words under it,
the card says so rather than stopping you: it is your pen, and it is also the contrast floor
the rest of the site is held to.

The inks that ship stay measured off a photograph of a real pen box, and a blog that never
opens the card serves the exact same stylesheet, under the exact same address, that it
served before any of this existed. [ADR 0029](./docs/decisions/0029-the-pen-becomes-the-owners.md)
records the trade, and amends the decision that said these colours would never be a setting.

### Selecting text looks like this site

Drag across a sentence and the highlight is black on a light page and grey on a dark one,
in place of the browser's blue. That blue was the one colour on the page that came from
nowhere: everything else down to the hairline is the palette you chose, and the most
physical gesture a reader makes was borrowing the operating system's accent.

### A switch that clears the desk

The editor grew a **Focus** switch (and `Ctrl/Cmd + \`): one press takes the list of your
writing and the whole button row off the screen and leaves the paper. Nothing is lost while
it is on, because selecting text still raises the formatting bar and "/" still opens the
inserts. The default is unchanged.

The same pass fixed what a 13-inch laptop was actually looking at. The list of your writing
used to sit beside the editor from 1280px, which left the button row 630 pixels to fit 787
into: it wrapped to two lines, the line above it wrapped to two more, and there were three
tiers of chrome above the first word. The list now joins the editor at 1640px, where there
is room for both, and below that the paper gets the window.

## 2026-08-22 — Quire Ink 2.1.4

The day after the editor day, spent auditing rather than writing: the whole source, the
analytics behind it, and every screen at four widths — phone, iPad upright, iPad sideways,
desktop. What the audit found is below. Still a drop-in: same install, same settings, same
database, no migrations. **One new environment variable**, `UPDATE_CHECK`, which exists so
you can turn a new behaviour off.

### Your blog now knows when a release is out

Once a day, on the first visit it gets, your blog asks `check.quireink.com` what the newest
release is, and the dashboard wears the answer as a dot beside the version: amber when a
newer release exists, green when you are on it, and nothing at all when it has not asked
recently — "up to date" is a claim, and a stale answer cannot make it. Nothing updates
itself: knowing a release exists and installing it are separate acts, and the second one
stays yours.

The same request is how a running blog is counted, and the request was designed around
that: what goes out is the version, a code rebuilt from a new date every midnight so no two
days can be linked, and whether the site has a public address yet. Not your address, not
your posts, not your readers, not your figures — the whole request is one line, written out
in [the self-hosting guide](./docs/self-host.md#10-what-this-blog-tells-us-and-how-to-stop-it).
Turn it off in Settings → System or with `UPDATE_CHECK=0`, and it stays quiet on its own
under `bun --watch` and `bun test`, because an afternoon of development is not an install.

### One clock for the whole site, and you choose it

The date under a post was the server's date. A public page is rendered once and cached, so
a post published at 18:00 UTC read "August 22" from a machine in London and "August 23"
from one in Hanoi — and moving the server silently moved every date on the site. The zone
is now a setting, **Settings → Site → Timezone**, and it is the site's whole clock: the
date under every post, the month markers in the archive, the newsletter's date line, and
the day an analytics chart starts on. `ANALYTICS_TZ` keeps working as the default until you
pick one. The picker offers what the runtime's own timezone database knows rather than
carrying a copy of it, and a typo cannot take a page down — an unknown zone falls back
instead of throwing.

### An uploaded SVG no longer gets to act on your site

An SVG is a drawing that is allowed to carry script, and `/uploads/` served one like any
other image. Opened directly in a tab, the browser ran that script on your blog's own
origin, where a fetch carries the owner's session cookie. Only the owner can upload, so the
shape of this is not a stranger's attack — it is the booby-trapped icon set you downloaded
and used as a logo. SVG responses now go out sandboxed. Used as an image on a page, nothing
changes: an `<img>` never ran script in the first place.

### Buttons sized for thumbs

Six controls in the admin — Export CSV among the analytics, the taxonomy tools, Copy URL
and Delete in the media library, the tour's "Got it" — were exactly as tall as their own
text: 16 pixels, on screens where a fingertip is 40. Each now has a full-size hit area
without its ink moving a pixel, and the checkboxes — where a browser silently ignores
padding on the native widget — carry their label as part of the target.

### A meta line wraps between its facts

At phone width the reading time on every card could break in the middle of itself — "4" at
the end of one line, "min read" opening the next — and a date could split across its own
comma. Each fact now holds together, and the line breaks between facts.

### Two untrue sentences, and line endings

The self-hosting guide's systemd unit produced an install that would never have been
counted, because the update check originally demanded an environment variable the unit
never set; the check now recognises a real install by what it is rather than by a
declaration, so the unit works as written. The schema doc claimed there was exactly one
place that assembles SQL from a variable when there were two — the second, `vacuum into`,
is now documented at both ends. And the repository pins its line endings: 98 files carried
a mix of CRLF and LF, which made a one-line edit read as a rewrite.

## 2026-08-21 — Quire Ink 2.1.3

A day of editor bugs, all found by one person writing one post. The owner pasted a Markdown
article into the writing surface and got a white screen; every fix below came out of chasing
that, and three of them were found by the tests written to catch the first two.

Nothing here changes how the thing is installed or run. Still a drop-in: same install, same
settings, same database, no migrations, **no new environment variables**.

### Pasting a Markdown article now makes a post

It did not. Pasted text arrived verbatim — the headings kept their `#`, a table stayed a wall
of pipes, a fence stayed three backticks — and it saved worse than it looked: the serializer
escapes what it is handed, so the draft that reached the database read `\# Heading` and
`&gt; quote`, and the post published as its own source code. One option in the Markdown
extension had never been switched on. A paste inside a code block, and a paste made with Shift
held, still arrive as plain text, which is what both gestures mean.

### The editor stopped going blank, twice

Both were the same shape of mistake in the pen's own Markdown rules, and both ended the same
way: a throw inside the parse, inside a React render, and an admin that unmounted itself into
a white page with nothing in the console that a writer could act on.

**`**bold** and ==ink==` in one paragraph.** The rule that parses a stroke's contents handed
the nested parse the token array the outer parse was still holding indices into; markdown-it
finishes an inline pass by splicing that array, every recorded index shifted, and the next
lookup threw. Emphasis BEFORE the stroke was required to reach it, which is why `==ink== and
**bold**` had always been fine and nothing anybody wrote deliberately ever hit it.

**A stroke inside a link label** — `[**@@Quire Ink@@**](https://…)`. markdown-it scans a link
label by running every inline rule in silent mode and then checking that a rule which claimed
a match moved the cursor. All three pen rules, and the inline maths rule, claimed without
moving. It needs the delimiter to be INSIDE the brackets, so a day of round-trip fixtures that
put the stroke beside a link walked past it.

### A page that fails no longer takes the admin with it

There was no error boundary anywhere in the admin, so any error thrown while a page rendered
unmounted the entire tree — sidebar, rail, everything. That is what turned a parser bug into a
blank browser tab. A failing page now becomes a sheet that says what happened, says the work
is still held on the device, offers to reload or to leave, and shows the error's own message
so a report can be more than "it went blank". It sits inside the canvas and outside the
sidebar, so the rail keeps working and leaving the page is what clears it.

### Tables stopped losing cells

Four of these, all of them a save rather than an edit, which means the writer does nothing
wrong and finds out later:

| Written | Saved, before |
|---|---|
| `\| $x^2$ \| hai \|` | `\|  \| hai \|` |
| a cell holding an image | the same, emptied |
| a cell holding an escaped pipe | one column fewer, and again on the next save |
| a merged cell, or a cell of two blocks | the literal text `[table]` — the whole table |

The first two are one cause: the serializer asked whether a cell had TEXT before writing it,
and a formula keeps its TeX in an attribute while an image is a leaf block with no text at
all. The third is that a pipe inside a cell was written bare, so the next open re-cut the row.
The fourth was a fallback that replaced an entire table with seven characters — reachable by
pasting a table from a web page, by pressing Enter inside a cell, or by deleting the header
row with the button that offers to. A table Markdown cannot express is now downgraded rather
than deleted: the shape is lost, the words are kept, the columns stay aligned.

### A list that mixes bullets and checkboxes stopped growing

`- một` / `- hai` / `- [x] ba` is one list in Markdown, and the whole list was being marked as
checkboxes because one item was. The two plain items were lifted out, the empty checkbox list
that remained had to be given an item, and the post gained a `- [ ]` nobody wrote — which
parsed on the next open as an empty task item, saved as `- \[ \]`, and grew from there. The
runs are now split into a list each, in the order they were written.

### Publishing reaches readers immediately

Measured from the owner's own publish: nine seconds passed between pressing Publish and the
CDN being told to drop its copy, because the purge was the last step of a walk that re-renders
every public page — 79 pages, 6.5 seconds, a number that grows with the archive. Meanwhile the
manual "Clear cache" button did it in 183ms. The two jobs were never one job: the warm is for
origin latency and can take as long as it likes, the purge is what makes readers see the new
post. The purge now fires about 50ms after the write; a bulk import still purges at most
twice.

### A link is underlined by the pen, in dashes ([ADR 0028](docs/decisions/0028-a-link-is-a-pen-gesture.md))

A body link was invisible, and measurably so: `--c-link` against body text is 1.24:1 on the
default palette and never reaches the 3:1 that colour-as-the-only-cue wants, while the
hairline under it sat at 1.16–1.33:1 across all twelve palette-and-mode pairs. Colour set
darker and a heavier weight were both built and refused by measurement. A link now carries the
mark a reader draws under a line they mean to come back to — dashes, tiling rather than
stretching, so a longer link gets more of them rather than bigger ones, and visibly not the
solid `++underline++` a writer draws. It costs 0.99 KB gzipped and rides in the sheet every
page already loads.

### How the editor is tested now

The two blank pages were found by the owner, not by 1,485 tests, and the reason was
structural. `golden/corpus/` holds 45 Markdown fixtures and this project has two parsers —
one for the reader's page, gated by the golden compare, and one for the WRITER'S page, which
had never been handed a single fixture. Half the software was untested against the corpus.
And every fixture written for the pen tested one gesture in one sentence, while both bugs
lived in combinations.

So the corpus now runs through the editor as well, alongside 186 generated cases — six
gestures against sixteen containers, including the two that mattered: after emphasis, and
inside a link label. The law asserted is a fixed point rather than an exact string: opening
and saving may normalise, but a document that keeps changing every time it is opened is
silent corruption on a timer, and a parse that throws is a white screen. That suite found the
table bugs on its first run. A post containing every shape that has ever broken the editor is
also opened in a real browser by the tour and saved twice, because a DOM shim never mounts
React the way a browser does and both white pages ENDED in React.

1,736 tests, sixty browser flows.

### Docker Hub, for the people the image exists for

The image is published to Docker Hub as `quireink/quireink` as well as GHCR — the same bytes,
built once and copied, so a version number cannot come to mean two different images — because
GHCR cannot be searched from a Synology or QNAP container UI at all. Its page had an empty
description, no overview and no category, which is what Docker Hub's search reads, so the
image was unfindable for exactly the audience it was published for. Both READMEs and the
self-hosting guide now lead with a pull rather than a clone-and-build, and name the NAS case
where a NAS owner will look.

## 2026-08-21 — Quire Ink 2.1.2

**This release replaces 2.1.1, which is withdrawn.** 2.1.1 shipped on 2026-08-20 and lived
one day. It was not wrong about anything it set out to do — the pen work below is its work —
but it went out with book mode already dead on current Chrome, and it had no way of knowing:
nothing in this project tested that path. 2.1.2 is everything 2.1.1 was, plus the fix, plus a
day of work the same review turned up. There is no reason to run 2.1.1, and its tag and
release are gone; upgrading from 2.1.0 or earlier lands here directly.

Still a drop-in: same install, same settings, same database, no migrations, **no new
environment variables**.

### Book mode was broken on Chrome 148, on every install

Every article opened in the reader showed "1 / 1" and both arrows were dead. Chrome stopped
treating a multi-column element's overflow columns as scrollable overflow — measured, the
flow reported 3,964px of content while its scroll container reported 279px, and an assigned
`scrollLeft` snapped back to 0 — so the count was taken from a number that had gone blind and
every turn was a no-op. Chrome then also stopped **painting** those columns, so the first fix
produced a blank second page with the words laid out and undrawn.

Turning a page is now a transform on the flow under a clipping viewport, the count reads the
flow's own width, and the flow is sized to hold every column as a real column box, because
real columns paint. Two browser tour flows pin all three, desktop and phone. The tour had no
book-mode flow at all, which is how a dead feature stayed green through fifty-seven checks.

### The pen learns to draw like a hand ([ADR 0025](docs/decisions/0025-the-pen-varies-itself.md), [ADR 0026](docs/decisions/0026-the-pen-learns-to-underline-and-ring.md))

Carried from 2.1.1 unchanged. It began with photographs: a notebook and two textbooks full of
real highlighting, put next to the demo with the verdict that the demo's strokes looked
machine-stamped. They did, for a reason the code could name — every highlight was one SVG die
stretched to fit, and the jitter meant to hide it counted siblings, so on a site where most
paragraphs hold one highlight it never fired. A page of twelve highlights wore one silhouette
twelve times.

Stroke shapes are now **grown from a seeded generator, not drawn**: ten dies varying tilt,
weight, edge tremor, chisel ends, an occasional taper where the pen lifted, a dry lane where
the felt split, pooled ink along the top edge, a darker spot where the pen was set down — and
forty grips deciding how each stroke sits on its words. Which variant a highlight wears comes
from a hash of its own text, so it is scattered across the page and stable across re-renders:
a page that reshuffled its ink on every visit would feel haunted rather than hand-made.

**Two more gestures.** `++text++` draws a pencil underline — bow, droop, taper, sometimes a
second re-inked pass — and `@@word@@` rings a word in red ballpoint. Both take `#green`-style
suffixes in ballpoint-strength versions of the five inks, because a thin line in the
highlighter's pastel pigment all but vanishes. The ring is two caps at a fixed width and a
middle that does all the stretching, so the curves stay hand-sized around any word. Both are
owner toggles (Settings → Reading), on by default, CSS only.

**The three-way stroke setting (marker / swipe / double) retires.** A pen that varies itself
leaves a picker between three uniformities nothing to do. Saved settings keep working.

**The U button stops losing work.** It applied StarterKit's underline mark, which has no
Markdown serialization, so every save dropped it silently — since the editor first shipped.
The editor owns `underline` now: same button, same Mod-U, saved as `++text++`.

### The pen ships only to the pages where it wrote ([ADR 0027](docs/decisions/0027-the-pen-ships-only-where-it-wrote.md))

All that ink cost bytes: 280 SVG data-URIs had grown to roughly 21 of the public
stylesheet's 29 KB gzipped, paid by every page including the ones with no ink on them. The
ink now ships as two hashed, immutable sheets of its own, linked render-blocking but only on
pages whose HTML actually contains a mark or an underline. `site.css` falls **28.7 → 7.6 KB
gzipped**; a page with no ink drops 21 KB and roughly 260 KB of CSS parse; a highlighted post
pays less than the old single sheet, across parallel cached requests. Deferred loading was
rejected: it shows bare words for a beat before the ink lands.

### The page reads like a set book

**A font swap that moves nothing.** Every text family now declares a metric-matched fallback —
the local face its stack falls back to, reshaped to the family's own measurements — so when
the web font arrives, glyphs change and line breaks do not. Measured across all four
families: 1,200 characters at 640px set the same 17 lines in Literata and in its fallback,
where bare Georgia set 16. The swap used to cost a full line of reflow.

**Hanging punctuation** hangs an opening quote into the margin the way a set book does, and
**hyphenation limits** stop justified text breaking words a compositor would refuse.

### Book mode: the reader's hand on the type, and fresher paper

The scale was one fixed number and read large; it is a touch more generous than the article
now, and **A− / A+** in the reader's chrome move it between 0.85 and 1.35, remembered per
browser. The paper was pulled hard toward yellow with a heavy grain — together an impression
of foxed stock rather than a classic page. It is a quiet warm ivory now, the grain is felt
more than seen, and the drop cap, the asterism and the spine all stay.

### The phone reads with its thumbs

Book mode kept the desktop's 48px side margins on a phone — a quarter of a 375px screen spent
on air. A phone page is the glass less 20px a side now, the mouse-sized arrows retire, and
pages turn by swipe or by a tap in the outer thirds, with the middle third left as a safe
place for a thumb. The reader also finally has a **way in on a phone**: both desktop entries
hide under 768px, so a working one-page book mode had no door. A floating button, twin to the
back-to-top circle and appearing on the same scroll, is it. The sidebar drawer's rows were
stacking a desktop gap on top of touch padding and sat about 27px apart; they close up.

### The owner picks what a first-time visitor opens in

Light or dark was the visitor's laptop and nothing else: a blog could not BE dark or BE
light, only mirror whoever was looking. **Settings → Appearance** now carries System / Light /
Dark above the palette grid. A reader who has chosen for themselves is untouched in every
case. New installs also start in Literata rather than the sans.

### Docker: bind mounts work, and the image is finally verified

The Docker path had no verification of any kind — the `Dockerfile` appeared in no test, no
tour flow and no workflow. Measured on a Linux daemon: a **root-owned bind mount**, which is
exactly what a Synology, QNAP or Unraid container UI produces, killed the container on boot
with `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`. The docs claimed it merely came up degraded; that was wrong.

The image now accepts **`PUID` / `PGID`** (1000:1000 by default, so nothing changes for
existing installs), adopts the mounted directories only when their ownership is actually
wrong, and drops privileges before the app starts — the app never runs as root. CI builds the
image and boots it twice, on a named volume and on a root-owned bind mount, and asserts the
process is unprivileged.

### Smaller things

A production-dependency stage, so a source-only change stops re-resolving the whole tree.
Two admin rows that lined up with nothing, and one `ResetButton` in the kit instead of three
hand-written copies that had already drifted. An audit pass over every markdown file after a
day that moved the pen's delivery, the fonts, book mode, the first paint and the install
defaults: fourteen confirmed drifts, corrected.

## 2026-08-18 — Quire Ink 2.1.0

**Thirty commits since 2.0.3, and nearly all of them are one project: the admin rebuilt
around writing** ([ADR 0024](docs/decisions/0024-the-admin-is-rebuilt-around-writing.md)).
2.0.3 made the admin look like the product; this release makes it *behave* like one — a
writing desk, not a control panel. It ran the way the last redesign should have: a mock
first, the owner's verdict on the mock, then the code page by page against it, and the
owner writing on each cut and ruling again. A dozen of these commits exist only because he
sat down to write and circled what was wrong. The mock's two ideas now hold everywhere: the
screen you write on shows the list of everything written beside the paper, and every other
screen is **one sheet per page** rather than a scatter of cards on a canvas.

The upgrade is a drop-in: same install, same settings, same database, **no new environment
variables**. The one schema change is a search index for pages (`pages_fts`) that the
database creates by itself at boot, the same way every migration here runs. The reader's
pages did not move a byte — every bundle, stylesheet and font is identical to 2.0.3 —
because all of this is the owner's side of the house.

And the project has a front door now: **[quireink.com](https://quireink.com)** is the
homepage — three static pages, no process behind them, which is the product's own taste
applied to its marketing. **[demo.quireink.com](https://demo.quireink.com)** remains the
running build, its bar now linking back to this repository.

### The admin could not find a sentence the owner remembered writing

That was the first defect of the run, and it set the theme. The content screen's filter
matched title, tags and categories — over the array the page had already been handed. The
body text was never in the browser, so a phrase from inside a draft returned nothing, and a
draft is what the box is most needed for.

The index had existed the whole time: `posts_fts`, FTS5 over title *and* body with
`remove_diacritics 2`, serving the reader's `/search` since the port. The admin simply
never asked it anything. Now it does, with the reader's two filters removed, because the
person typing wrote the drafts and is allowed to see them. **Pages join the same index**
(the release's one migration), since the admin's one list holds both. The box keeps its
instant title match and adds the server's body match behind a 180ms debounce — and a row
that matched on its body **shows the passage it matched in**, because without that line it
looks like a row that matched on nothing. Typing `gioi thieu` finds "Giới thiệu"; the
verification flow types a phrase that appears in no title and must land on the post that
carries it in its body.

### Four drawers became one list

Posts · Pages · Taxonomy · Series stood as four equal tabs, and the owner's verdict was
that it read as WordPress. The mechanism behind the feeling is specific: to look for
something you had to decide which drawer it was in *before* you could look, and two of the
four drawers were not content at all — renaming a category and ordering a series are
maintenance, done rarely, taking a quarter of the screen's attention daily.

Now it is one stream, posts and pages together, most recently touched first. They already
shared the `/{slug}` namespace and the search index; the split only ever existed in the
screen. Each row carries a line of the writing under its title — the excerpt normally, the
matched passage while searching. The date column says "Last touched" in six languages,
because that is what it holds; a column headed *Date* showing the last save is a small lie
repeated on every row.

### The editor asked its questions first

The old writing surface put twenty-four buttons over the text, five of them an exact
duplicate of the bubble bar that has always appeared on a selection, and opened the full
attributes column — slug, date, status, terms, series, two image pickers, SEO — on every
load, asking while the writer was mid-sentence and taking 340px of the width.

The attributes are **closed** now, and the first Publish press opens them *instead of
publishing*: every field already carries an answer, so it is a review, not a form.
Publishing again publishes. They slide in from the right over a scrim, footered
Later / Publish, deliberately narrow because the fields are a column of short answers. And
the sheet draws **its own calendar**: `<input type="datetime-local">` popped the browser's
blue popup into a monochrome admin, and no stylesheet can reach that popup. The new field
keeps the native value — every caller and save path untouched — but the grid is
Monday-first from `Intl`, the picked day is the admin's black pill, and today is a hairline
ring.

### The toolbar left, and came back the size the owner ruled

The mock-faithful cut removed the toolbar entirely: `/` on an empty line raises the insert
menu at the caret — image, gallery, table, code, the two formulas, divider, and the block
types with their Markdown shortcuts printed beside them, so the menu teaches the gesture
that makes itself unnecessary. Then the owner wrote in that editor for an afternoon and
ruled three times, and each ruling was applied as said: the **formatted view gets the full
button row back** — "/" is enough in Markdown, the normal view wants a toolbar — at the top of the
sheet, full width, wrapping on a narrow window instead of hiding half its controls behind a
horizontal drag, with the buttons grouped in the middle. The Markdown view stays bare —
raw text formats itself, so a strip of formatting buttons over it is furniture. The switch
that gets you there is spelled "Markdown", sits beside Attributes in the action line, and
while it is on the editor draws no toolbar at all. `/` and the selection bubble remain:
two doors, same rooms.

The chrome became one piece on the way. The action line — back link, save state, word
count and reading time, the three buttons — is the sheet's **own** top row, the toolbar
attaches directly beneath it, and the two stay joined while scrolling. The title sits on
the paper itself, with status and last-touched under it. Recovered work folded into the
action line as a sentence with two links, Restore the darker of the two because it is the
one that rescues somebody's words. Every clipped scroller — tag cloud, slide-over,
combobox, the `/` menu — fades at its cut edge, because a hard crop mid-row reads as
broken and the fade says *there is more*. And the bug the owner found by writing: selecting
the **first line** of a post put the bubble bar under the sticky toolbar, covered and
unclickable — the one sentence he could not format was the opening one. Fixed, with the
regression flow watched red first.

### The write screen: the list beside the paper

`/admin/content` is not a dashboard anymore; it is the write screen, and it is two panes.
The left pane is the writing itself — the one list, its body-reaching search, and one dark
New post button — riding beside **both** editors from wide windows up, marking the row you
have open. Below the wide breakpoint the sheet takes the room and the list is one "← Write"
away. Focus mode used to hide all navigation while writing; the rail stays now, because
the owner circled it on the mock.

Then he used it, and four more verdicts landed in one sitting. The three scope tabs grew to
**five** — All · Pages · Posts · Published · Drafts, a kind family and a status family on
one row — and they hold that one row in *all six languages*, each locale given its own
deliberately short words, the row stretched flush to the pane's edge instead of stopping
short of it. Scrolled, the pane and the sheet pin at the same top instead of two offsets
24px apart. The date beside a published post is its **publication** date — the last save
there read as a wrong publish time — and a quiet button cycles the sort between
last-updated and date-created. Taxonomy and Series, which had ended up below panes that
had just grown to window height ("a door nobody can see"), became quiet tools on the
pane's own sort line, opening as slide-over sheets from the right.

### Eleven doors, when the owner came to write and to see how it went

The rail listed eleven destinations, so the first screen of a writing tool asked for a
decision about drawers before it offered either the writing or the reading. **The rail is
four now** — Home, Write, Library, Newsletter — and everything else lives behind one
"Everything else" button that opens *itself* when the current page is one of them, because
a rail that hides where you are would be a worse fault than a long one. Nothing was
removed. The group **remembers the owner's choice** across sessions: an explicit click on
the row persists, while the visit-driven opening never writes — only the owner's own hand
records a preference.

Analytics could leave the rail because its numbers moved to the home screen: the Traffic
card carries views, visitors, time per post and read-through over the window it names once.
And the writing comes back before anything else does — **"Pick up where you left off"** is
the four most recently touched unfinished pieces, each chip a click from the cursor, with a
door to the rest when there are more. The administration counts — posts, pages, comments,
images, storage — moved below the widgets; they are inventory, and inventory is what this
rebuild moves out of the way.

The rail also learned it has **two registers**. The footer's controls — theme, Clear
cache, Sign out — wore the same row dress as the destinations above them, so the rail read
as nine pages, one of them apparently named "Light". Controls are smaller and quieter now,
at control radius; destinations keep their size. The theme menu itself had two faults with
one cause each: its items were 16px in a 14px rail (a public type role that resolves to
nothing in the admin), and it floated under the content, because a sticky rail is its own
stacking context and the later sibling painted over it. It opens upward *inside* the rail
now, at rail size. And the "Show icons" switch moved into Everything else — a set-once
device preference does not need a permanent footer row — and it governs the whole rail,
footer glyphs included, by the owner's ruling.

### Every page is one sheet

The mock's second idea, applied to the seven remaining pages plus the activity log, each as
its own commit. Four laws, held by shared primitives rather than by discipline: the page is
**one full-width sheet**; a page's tools live on the **sheet's own first row** — tabs,
search, counts, the quiet dangerous verb; headline numbers **stand directly on the paper**
in a band, not in little boxes; and lists of short rows fill **two newspaper columns** with
a hairline rule between them, one column on a phone. Every page is the same width on
purpose: no two pages come out at different widths.

- **Library** went first and carried the primitives in: kind tabs on the sheet's first
  row, the tab's own toolbar (count · search · sort) bleeding to the sheet's edges as a
  second chrome row — the editor's two-row chrome, worn by a library — and the intro
  sentence demoted to the sheet's closing small print.
- **Analytics** stopped floating seven cards: the range strip and the privacy note share
  the first row, the five headline numbers stand in the band with their trend arrows and
  the new/returning split riding along, and all seven top-lists went bare — columns
  divided by vertical hairlines on the sheet itself. Export waits quietly in the page
  head.
- **Comments became the reading queue.** Each comment is two lines of its own text — click
  to read in full — with the whole ledger (who, where, when, from what address) as one
  line of small print underneath and Delete as a quiet word at its end. The six-column
  spreadsheet is gone. The queue gets the admin's search, over text, name and post title,
  its hits painted with the pen.
- **Newsletter**: three counts on the paper, the SMTP warning as a full-width line, and
  the subscriber list as one-line ledgers — the address is the thing, the log's facts
  follow as small print, and the dot ahead of a pending address is the pen's edge tone,
  the list's own work-in-progress.
- **Trash**: kind tabs with their counts, "empty this kind" as a quiet tool beside them,
  and one row shape carrying posts, pages, media, files and comments alike — the thing
  first, then the deletion date and the two verbs that decide its fate.
- **Settings**: the tabs and the search that reaches past them share the first row, and
  all 26 cards became hairline **panels** — one radius step under the sheet's, title on a
  ruled header row — so a tab reads as sections of one page instead of boxes on a canvas.
  The always-reachable save bar stays fixed, because a footer Save on a tab three screens
  tall is a Save nobody can reach.
- **Help** is prose, so the guide packs its sections as hairline panels in two columns —
  the owner's ruling, after a centred reading column was tried first.
- **The activity log** became two columns of one-line ledgers — time, an action chip, the
  detail — with its count and Clear on the first row. An error is an inverted monochrome
  chip, not a red badge.

### Monochrome, plus exactly one colour

The Writing Desk mock is not monochrome — it carries exactly one colour, the product's own
highlighter, and the build had left it out entirely. **The pen arrives** in its three
places: a search hit wears it as a mark, folded per *character* so the indices survive
Vietnamese diacritics; the dots that mean work-in-progress — a draft's row, the unsaved
state, the unfinished chips on the home screen — are its edge tone; and dark mode uses the
mock's own dark pen values. A second use of colour would spend the only signal that means
"your words", so there is none.

The style sweep around it was audited two ways — computed styles read out of the running
admin, page by page and settings tab by settings tab, then a grep of the classes — and
fixed what either found. The 12px radius tier existed nowhere in the contract and eight
places in the code; it is gone, and the ladder is three steps: sheet, panel, control. Two
in-page shadows died (the admin draws none except on overlays). The last two reds left the
monochrome admin — the error card carries a strong border and a "!", the backup-delete
link carries the word itself.

### Every admin screen fits a phone, and the check that proves it

One tour flow per screen now asserts, at 375px, that the whole document is no wider than
the window — and names the widest element when it is not. All of them were watched fail
against a deliberate sabotage before being trusted, and the first clean run caught a real
one: analytics scrolled sideways by 36px, because the range strip sat in a row whose
comment *said* it wraps and whose classes did not. The browser tour is 57 flows now, up
from 40 at 2.0.3.

### The README starts with a reader, and the licence stops turning operators away

The README's second line was "One process. Two SQLite files." A person who writes and does
not deploy stopped there, and everything below was written for somebody who already knew
what those words meant. "What it is" now opens the page in nine plain sentences — what it
is like, that you change it by clicking, what a post costs a reader, what an AI can do for
you, what you need to start, and what you take on in exchange. The technical opening is
intact one heading below, in both languages.

And the licence said no to the wrong people. The relicense had been written on the
sentence "nobody may make money from it", which blocked a host that installs published
releases and sells the operation of them as firmly as it blocked the fork-and-rename it
was written for. Only the second was ever the point.
[`LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md`](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md) now grants commercial use of a **published
release run unmodified**, on four conditions: notices stay, credit and no passing off,
sell the service not the software, and security fixes only, reported within 30 days.
Commercial use of a modified copy still needs asking
([ADR 0023](docs/decisions/0023-commercial-use-of-unmodified-releases.md)).

### The demo grew pictures, and the docs caught up

The five seeded posts on the demo now carry their plates in the prose — the nib angles in
the pen post, the imposition sheet and registration target in the press pair, the
modular-scale bars and the return-sweep diagram in the reading series — so the library and
the reading page have something real to show, and the pen post closes with an exercise
anyone can do with two pencils. The README's admin picture was reshot from the sheet-era
admin, and [`docs/admin-design.md`](docs/admin-design.md) plus the feature docs describe
the admin that exists rather than the one that used to.

*57 tour flows, 1416 tests, and the seven build guards, all green before the tag.*

## 2026-08-15 — Quire Ink 2.0.3

**Forty-three commits since 2.0.1, and 2.0.2 is folded into this one.** 2.0.2 went out on 10
August and stood for five days; everything it shipped is in this release, and its notes are
below under the line rather than summarised. There is one release to read and one to install.

The thirty-four commits since 2.0.2 split in three. Eleven are a pre-release audit of jobs this
software had left to somebody else — it had no upload cap, no storage quota, no bind address
the server would admit to, and nothing at all holding the one rule the whole design rests on,
one blog and one owner. In each case a reverse proxy, a firewall rule or a habit had been
covering, which is exactly why none of them had ever shown. Then the admin, which had
stopped looking like the product it belongs to. Then a run of defects the owner found by using it: a false 404 on a rename, a focus ring drawn for the wrong kind of control, and code blocks that were neither blocks nor coloured.

**Four new environment variables across the two, and one of them changes what an existing
install does at boot** — read the first entry before upgrading. `HOST`, `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` and
`STORAGE_QUOTA_GB` are new here; `TRUST_PROXY` arrived in 2.0.2 and almost nobody needs to set
it. The upgrade is otherwise a drop-in: same install, same settings, same database.
### The server listened on every interface, under a log line that said it did not

`Bun.serve` with no `hostname` listens on `0.0.0.0`. The line printed underneath it said
`127.0.0.1`. Measured across four running instances, every one was bound `*:port`, and nothing
was reachable only because a firewall rule said so — a defence one rule deep, sitting under a
log that told whoever checked the opposite of the truth.

**`HOST` now exists and defaults to `127.0.0.1`**, and the boot line prints what `Bun.serve`
came back with rather than what the code hoped it did. Every layout in
[`docs/self-host.md`](docs/self-host.md) puts the proxy on the same box, so loopback is right
for all of them.

**If your proxy is on another machine, or the process runs in a container that has to be
reachable from outside it, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` before upgrading.** The bundled Docker image sets
it, because inside a container loopback is the container's own.

### Nothing in this software refused an upload

The only byte limit anywhere in the tree belonged to the WordPress importer. What actually
refused an oversized image was `client_max_body_size` — whatever the operator's proxy happened
to say, and nothing at all if there was no proxy.

**`MAX_UPLOAD_MB` (default 64) and `STORAGE_QUOTA_GB` (default 5)**, enforced in the storage
driver rather than in a route, so a route that forgets cannot write past them. The owner gets
two admin fields that can **lower** either number and can never raise it: the environment is the
ceiling, the setting is a preference, and `0` on either side means "no cap from me".

Refusals happen before the bytes are read rather than after: `413`, with `file_too_large` or
`quota_exceeded`. The worst of the six byte paths was the MCP tool `add_media_from_url`, where
the bytes arrive on a fetch the server itself made and no proxy has an opinion at all — it
buffered a whole remote body into memory, and now stops reading at the cap.

### Five advisories sat in the lockfile and nothing was able to see them

`bun audit` found five, one of them high, while the repository's alert list was empty. GitHub
builds its dependency graph from `package.json` — 34 packages, exactly the direct dependencies —
and never parses `bun.lock`. So no indirect advisory can produce an alert, and a direct one
cannot either when the caret range permits a fixed version the lockfile is not on.

**`bun audit` runs in CI as its own job** and fails the build on a finding. The five are
cleared: `hono` 4.13.1, `nodemailer` 9.0.5, `marked` 18.0.9, `shiki` 4.4.3, and `fast-uri`
pinned through `overrides` at `^3.1.5` — inside the major `ajv` declares, because `bun update`
on a transitive package writes it into `dependencies` and jumps to 4.x, which fixes an advisory
by breaking the library that consumes it. None of the four `hono` advisories was reachable from
this code, which was established before the bump rather than assumed after it.

### One owner was the design, and nothing in the software held it

Any row in `users` holding a session is the owner: there are no roles and no per-user scoping
anywhere, by design ([ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-no-saas-single-instance.md)). The CLI would
still create a second account, and a second account on this schema is not two users — it is two
people sharing one identity.

`createUser` refuses when an account already exists. Its test-only escape hatch is honoured
**only** under the test runner, so a signup route written against it would pass its own tests
and refuse in production, which is the failure mode worth having.

### There is no compiled binary, and `bun run build` stops implying one

The last open question from the 2.0 rewrite, now
[ADR 0022](docs/decisions/0022-ship-from-source-not-a-compiled-binary.md). `bun build --compile`
bundles `sharp`'s JavaScript and not its native module, and both halves of the old note turned
out worse than it said: the binary does not throw on the first image call, it **dies on the boot
path before it ever listens**; and "one executable plus a native module directory beside it"
does not exist as an option, because `sharp` resolves from the bundle's own `/$bunfs/root/…`
path, so the real `@img/*` copied next to the executable fails identically.

`bun run build` now builds the two artefacts that actually ship — the island bundles and the
admin SPA — and nothing else. It had been emitting `dist/quireink` under a note saying not to
deploy it "yet"; anybody who deployed it anyway was deploying something that has never worked.
Quire Ink ships as source run by Bun, which is what the Docker image and every documented
layout already did.

### A feed and a sitemap full of `http://localhost:3000`, with nothing saying so

`SITE_URL` unset does not "derive per request" — a comment claimed that for months while nothing
derived anything, and the real answer was `http://localhost:3000` in every canonical tag, feed
and sitemap. It stays a constant deliberately: the page cache is keyed by path alone, so one
request carrying `Host: evil.example` would poison the sitemap for everyone. Deriving it is
cache poisoning with extra steps.

What changed is that the absence is loud — a `[WARN]` at boot naming the variable, and an admin
hint that says what breaks rather than what to type, in all six languages.

### Readers can pick a palette, and a blog ships only the palettes it enables

Six palettes have shipped since 2.0 and no reader could reach any of them: the switcher was
never ported from 1.x, so `enabledPalettes` was a setting with nothing behind it while the CSS
for all six sat inline on every page.

`themesToCss` now takes the enabled list. Below two enabled it emits **no** `[data-palette]`
rules at all, because the switcher hides itself and `:root` already *is* the palette. Measured
on a served page: one palette is 0 rule blocks and 35,662 bytes, six is 12 blocks and 37,432 —
**1,770 bytes raw and 423 gzipped off every page load**, in the inline half of the stylesheet
that no cache spares.

And the switcher is ported, so enabling one now means something: 564 bytes, after the theme menu
and the palette menu were made one `dropdown()` rather than two. The reader bundle budget moved
8,800 → 9,600 as a decision rather than a nudge mid-fix, and both READMEs moved with it — the
reader's JavaScript is 3.6 KB gzipped on a listing and 7.8 KB on a post.

**Driving it in a browser found a bug no test would have.** Both header controls sit in the same
corner and each stopped its own click from reaching the handler that closes menus, so the theme
menu and the palette menu could be open at once, overlapping. Neither was wrong alone. Opening
one now closes the others.

### The editor's save bar never mentioned the copy on your own disk

The local draft snapshot has been written since 2.0 — on an interval, and again on leaving,
hiding or unmounting the editor — and the bar only ever spoke about the server, so `unsaved` was
displayed over work that was already on disk. A feature that exists and says nothing reads as a
feature that does not exist, and this one was asked for twice.

`autosaveSeconds` is a setting now (default 120, floored at 15) and the bar has a fourth state:
"kept on this device at HH:MM". The floor is the reverse of the obvious worry — a long interval
is safe *because* the leave, hide and unmount flushes exist, while a very short one would make
the interval the whole safety net again. It is still not a server autosave, for the reasons in
`useLocalDraft.ts`.

### Motion durations are three tokens instead of twelve literals

Twelve declarations across three files carried four values for three intents, and `.13s` next to
`.15s` is the same idea written twice — the drift a token set exists to stop. `--dur-fast` .15s,
`--dur-base` .2s, `--dur-slow` .5s. No `--ease` token: its value would be the keyword `ease`,
and the scroll-driven animations must stay `linear`. The sign-in page keeps its literals because
it never receives the public stylesheet, where a `var()` resolves to nothing and drops the
transition silently.

### `bun run tour` — thirty-six flows in a real browser, with a verdict each

`check:all` proves the code compiles and the seams hold. It cannot tell you that a column
collapsed, or that a control the owner switched on has nothing behind it; both of those have
shipped. The tour seeds its own instance on its own port, drives one browser through the
reader's controls, every admin page, a draft saved and published and trashed and restored, an
upload refused for being too large and an archive built — then deletes everything it made.

First run was 32 of 36, and **all four failures were the tour's own assumptions rather than the
app's behaviour**: a category link mistaken for a post link, the Help page reported broken
because its troubleshooting table mentions a URL that 404s, and two API routes that do not
exist. That is the honest result for a suite written this late, and the wrong assertions were
the useful part — a suite that cries wolf is worse than no suite, so the admin's not-found state
is now readable as a fact instead of being detected by the word "404" appearing on a page.

### The backup had never been opened, only weighed

The tour's backup flow read the first two bytes of the archive and confirmed a gzip member.
That proves an export happened; it says nothing about whether the owner's blog comes back out
of it. Both failure modes this project has actually met are invisible to that check: a
snapshot taken as a file copy captures a torn write-ahead log that only appears on restore,
and the uploads tree has been written to one path and read from another for months with
nothing going red.

`bun run tour` now ends with **`bun scripts/restore-check.ts`** — outside the browser,
because a page cannot untar an archive or open SQLite. It downloads the export, extracts it,
and asks the four questions the manual procedure in [`docs/backups.md`](docs/backups.md) asks:
both databases pass `integrity_check`, every table holds at least the rows it held before the
snapshot, every upload is byte-identical, and the archive carries all three members.

**It uploads one image first, and that is the point rather than a detail.** The seeded fixture
writes `media` ROWS and no files, and the tour deletes the image it uploads, so the uploads
tree is empty by the time this runs: `all 0 upload(s) are in the archive` would have passed
forever while proving nothing. An empty assertion is worse than no assertion, because it reads
as coverage. The probe is taken back out afterwards — and taking it out needs TWO calls, since
`/api/media/delete` is a soft delete that keeps the bytes on purpose.

Two things were found by writing it rather than by running it. Counting the live rows AFTER
the export reports the export's own `activity_log` row as data loss — the first run said
`activity_log 48→47` over a perfectly intact archive — so the counts are taken before the
snapshot and the assertion is one-directional. And the check was made to fail on purpose,
against a tampered file and a missing one, because a check that has never been red is a
decoration.

### The two queued compiler flags, measured and declined

`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` were both queued for "once the
port is finished". It is finished, so both were run — and both are declined, on the rule
`noImplicitReturns` was declined under: a flag you work around teaches people to work around
the compiler.

97 findings and 37 respectively, and every non-test file carrying more than one was read.
Not one was reachable at runtime: capture groups read after `.exec` returned non-null,
`?? LIST[0]` on module-constant arrays that are never empty, `split()[0]`, a SHA-1 digest
indexed inside its own 20 bytes, and seventeen in one file from indexing a `Record<string,
string>` that the function above it fills with `''` for every key. The reasoning and the
numbers are now in `tsconfig.json` beside the flags, so the next person meets the measurement
rather than the queue entry.


### The admin was wearing the framework's clothes, not the product's

It was rejected as looking cheap. That is a fair reading of what was there, and
the fault was not workmanship: a grey canvas, rounded white cards, drop shadows and pill tabs
is the stock look every dashboard framework hands out, and none of it came from this product,
whose public side is paper and hairline rules. Twelve screens dressed as somebody else's
software.

So the vocabulary changed once, in the shared kit, and all twelve moved with it: a **paper**
canvas, sheets with a hairline instead of a shadow, a 10-8-6 radius ladder, and the shadow
reserved for something that genuinely floats over content. `check:admin-kit` gained a rule that
matches the SHAPE rather than the exact class string — a raised white surface on a shadow —
because six segmented controls had copied the tab strip's pill and every one of them differed
from the primitive by a single shade, so the existing check passed for months while the admin
carried seven of one control.

**One typeface.** The chrome font the admin borrowed from the site is gone; it is Inter and
nothing else, with one deliberate exception — the editor's writing surface and its title stay
in the reading face, because what you type there is what a reader will see. A test pins the
exception to four files by name, so a third face cannot arrive quietly.

**Sidebar icons are a preference, off by default**, remembered per machine. Collapse is always
available: a collapsed rail has no labels, so it always draws glyphs regardless of the setting.

Spacing was re-measured rather than re-guessed — the page rhythm went 32/12/12/24 to 40/16/24/24
— and two things the owner pointed at were fixed by measurement: the dashboard's stat tiles were
49% empty air and are now one ruled band, and two cards in a row sat 37px out of line at the
seam (0px now, top and bottom).

The version label reads `quireINK v2.0.3 (abc1234)`, linking to the **project** rather than to
the commit. The SHA is there to be read — does this match what was just shipped — and a
per-commit URL is a page nobody opens from a dashboard and 404s the moment a branch is rebased.

### Every admin screen downloaded a LaTeX engine

Measured on the Comments screen, which has neither an editor nor a formula on it: **212 KB
unpacked, 63 KB over the wire**, of Temml. Nothing was wrong with the code. `@/utils` needed
three regex helpers so `toPlainText` could drop a formula out of an excerpt, it took them from
`render/math.ts`, and an ESM import is not a menu — taking three helpers took the module, and
that module imports Temml at its top. Fifteen admin files import `@/utils`, so the bundler put
a LaTeX engine in the chunk every screen shares.

The grammar now lives in `render/math-syntax.ts`, which may never import a renderer; `math.ts`
re-exports all of it so the parsers that do render still ask one module for both halves. The
admin's first load drops from 682 KB unpacked to 470 KB, and the editor — the one screen that
actually renders maths — is unchanged.

### The front page's biggest slot was starved by a cap meant for a `<meta>` tag

An excerpt was clamped to 200 characters when SAVED. The front page's text kind then asked for
260 for its lead standfirst and could never be given them: the most-looked-at slot on the site
was bounded by a number chosen because search engines truncate a meta description past ~160.

Storage now keeps **280**, and each surface clamps again on the way out for its own reason —
the same shape `web/article.ts` already used for the share card. The demo's own standfirsts were
one line each and have been rewritten; they now run three to four.

### CJK stops being deliberately absent

The fixture said CJK was left out because no bundled subset carries a Han, kana or hangul glyph,
so it would "fall back to a system font and demonstrate the opposite of the point". That
confused what we SHIP with what the page RENDERS IN. Nothing CJK is shipped and nothing will be
— a CJK webfont is megabytes — but a stack that ends at the generic `serif` keyword hands the
choice to the browser's last-resort face, which differs on every machine and nobody picked.

The reading stacks now name PingFang, Hiragino, Yu Mincho, Malgun Gothic and the Noto families
before the generic, at zero download. And because 直 is one character drawn three ways, there is
one tail **per language** with `:lang(zh|ja|ko)` rules to select it, so a Japanese site is not
set in Chinese letterforms by whichever family the machine happens to have installed first.
The demo has three new posts — Chinese, Japanese and Korean — to prove it.

### The tour toured the wrong instance, and blamed the code

The tour serves its own seeded instance on port 3399, which is also the port a dev instance
runs on. With one already bound, the tour's server lost the bind, the health check was answered
by the OTHER instance, and forty flows ran against a database the tour never seeded: the
reader-side half passed on the same fixture, and all twenty-six admin flows failed `401` because
the session belonged to a different database. It reads as a specific, confident regression.
It cost an hour of bisecting one.

**The tour now refuses to start on a busy port**, before it builds or seeds. And the browser
binary is found rather than hardcoded: three scripts each carried the same Linux path, so on a
Mac the project's main verification tool opened with `ENOENT` on a directory with the wrong
platform in its name. `scripts/chrome-path.ts` looks in the places it is actually installed and
names the install command when it finds none.

### Renaming a draft and publishing it said "Not found"

The post saved, the address bar updated, and the shell then threw the editor away for a red
banner. Reported as editing a draft's link and then publishing landing on "Not found", and the post
was on disk the whole time.

A `router.refresh()` left over from the Next.js port, sitting after a raw `history.replaceState`.
The router keeps its own copy of the path and the raw call does not update it, so `refresh()`
bumped the epoch and the page re-fetched itself with the OLD slug. Its comment said it was
dropping "the client Router Cache (no stale RSC)" — neither of which exists here, and
`Route()` renders a different component per path, so every navigation already refetches on
mount. It bought nothing. `PageForm` had the identical two lines.

A tour flow drives the real form now and asserts all three symptoms at once. It was checked
against the bug put back, because a guard nobody has seen fail is not a guard.

### The Markdown source view, which had never been designed

Three things, and the first was a specificity accident rather than a decision: the textarea
asks for `outline-none`, `.admin-shell :focus-visible` is two classes, and the ring won — so
clicking into the source drew a 2px rectangle around a column 60vh tall. The rich editor has
had an explicit exception since it shipped; this surface never got one, and neither did the
post TITLE, which is the third and was found by photographing the second.

It was also set in Inter at 14px, so `##` and `|` did not line up. It is source: a mono face
at 15px on a 1.8 line now — the SYSTEM mono, under a name the site's own variables cannot
override, because measuring the obvious name first showed it resolving to a webfont and
undoing the admin's one-typeface rule for a mode most owners never open.

And the markers dim. A textarea cannot style part of itself, so the text is drawn twice: a
mirror underneath with `##`, `---`, `**`, `|` and the pen's `==` wrapped, and the textarea
over it with its own text made transparent. It stays the only source of truth — caret,
selection, undo and every keystroke are its own — and the mirror is `aria-hidden`.

### A code block was not a block, and a bare fence had no colours

`pre` carried padding, a radius and an overflow rule and no background, because Shiki writes
one as an inline style — and `vitesse-light` writes `#ffffff` on a `#fcfcfc` page. So a code
block was a white rectangle on a near-white one: the radius had nothing to round, the padding
read as an indent. Worse, that hex is baked into HTML cached under a hash of its Markdown, so
it outlived every palette a reader can pick. The panel comes off the palette now, with the
hairline the tables already use.

Then the colours. A fence that names nothing highlights as `text`, which has no tokens, so the
colour was only ever there for blocks that remembered a word after the backticks. Two answers,
and both were decided by measuring:

- **A guess, and a timid one.** Terminal output is the commonest untagged block there is, and
  colouring stray words inside an error message looks broken. Every rule needs a signal prose
  cannot fake — a shebang, two command lines, shell syntax, an executable path with a flag, an
  SQL verb, a quoted key. Below that bar it stays `text`.
- **When the guess declines, mark what is true anyway.** Forcing a grammar was tried and
  rejected on evidence: through `bash`, Shiki coloured `id` and `nếu` as commands and swallowed
  six words of Vietnamese as a string off one pair of quotes. So a language-less block gets the
  two things that survive not knowing the language — a quoted run on one line, and `$NAME` —
  by WEIGHT rather than colour, because the default palette is monochrome and a colour-only
  device does nothing on it.

And ```` ```typescript ```` never highlighted at all: the grammar was loaded, the fence said the
word, and the lookup missed because the id is `ts`. The corpus has had a fixture recording
exactly that since the port.

### The golden gate moved, for the first time, on purpose

Three of forty-five fixtures stopped matching Quire 1.x — all three the same behaviour, a fence
whose language could not be used. Their 1.x reference stays on disk **untouched**: those files
are what a renderer that no longer exists actually printed, so overwriting them would not
update the reference, it would destroy it, and the gate would go on reporting parity against
our own output. The new answers live in `golden/v2/`, the three are named in `DIVERGED` with a
reason each, and forty-two still hold the original contract. `CLAUDE.md` now says never
regenerate `v1`.

### Smaller things

- The Comments table gave the post title 97px, in which a normal headline wrapped to five lines
  and made every row 145px tall — sized by the column that matters least, while the comment
  beside it stayed clamped at two lines inside all that height. A minimum width and a clamp:
  176px and 65px.
- Settings has a search box. Seven tabs were defined and the owner still could not find a
  setting; four links elsewhere in the admin pointed at a tab deleted two weeks earlier.
- The onboarding steps can be opened again after being dismissed.
- A hint rendered in two different faces on one card, because the rule that chose the face keyed
  off the HTML TAG: `Setting`'s hint is a `<p>` and `ui/Input`'s identical hint is a `<span>`.
  Faces are chosen by ROLE now, and `check:admin-kit` fails a screen that names a typeface.
- The demo's posts carry 47 highlighter strokes and 67 formulas, against 12 and 5. A renderer
  feature absent from the fixture is a feature the demo claims and never proves.
- `content/themes.ts` split: palettes stay, the font presets and their tuned typography move to
  `content/fonts.ts`. One-way import, and `themes.ts` re-exports, so all 22 callers are
  unchanged.

### Also

- The README's feature table lost a quarter of its words and stopped wrapping its own labels.
  GitHub gives a markdown table no column widths, so `A highlighter` and `Leaving WordPress`
  broke across two lines; the labels are one word each now, and the two that need two are
  joined with a space the renderer cannot break on. The cells had drifted long enough that the
  table read as an essay with a heading column — a row is for telling somebody whether they
  want the thing, not for proving it to them.
- [ADR 0021](docs/decisions/0021-hosted-quire-ink-one-process-per-blog.md) records how a hosted
  tier would work if there is one: a control plane starting one process per blog, not a
  `tenant_id` column threaded through a schema built on one owner. A decision, not a feature.
- Two remote branches that would have reverted shipped work are deleted, their SHAs kept in the
  author's ledger so the commits stay reachable.
- `.design-sync/` — the generator inputs for previewing admin components in a design tool.
  Tooling only; nothing in `src/` imports it.
- The release procedure in [`docs/conventions/releases.md`](docs/conventions/releases.md) no
  longer tells you to check for a binary that is no longer built.
- `docs/conventions.md` reached 400 of the 400 lines `check:docs` allows, having been squeezed
  twice in one day to fit. It is now [`docs/conventions/`](docs/conventions/README.md), one file
  per surface — type, layout, colour, motion, IDE chrome, i18n, scripts, releases — the same cut
  [ADR 0010](docs/decisions/0010-four-homes-doc-layout.md) made for `docs/features/`. Two rules
  that had been filed by where their control sits rather than by what they govern moved with it:
  the font handles are with typography instead of with chrome reuse, and the mode × palette axes
  are with colour instead of with the header.

---

## Folded in from 2.0.2 — withdrawn as a separate release

**Twelve commits and not one new feature.** Every entry below is a defect, and eight of them
were found the same way the 2.0.1 fixes were: by driving the running site and measuring it,
not by reading the source. The notes are unedited from the 2.0.2 release; the rate-limit fix
is the reason nobody should be left on 2.0.1.

### The sign-in lockout lasted about a minute, and a forged header defeated the rate limit

Two defects in `server/rate-limit.ts`, both reachable from the internet.

**Every bucket was swept with whichever window the last caller happened to pass.** Public
endpoints charge a minute, sign-in fifteen, recovery codes an hour — one map, one sweep, and
the sweep applied the current caller's window to every key in it. So five failed sign-ins
wrote a fifteen-minute lockout and the next ordinary search request ninety seconds later
deleted it. On a site with any traffic the lockout was real for about a minute. A bucket now
carries the window it was written under and is judged by its own.

**`CF-Connecting-IP` was believed from anyone.** True that Cloudflare will not let a client
forward that header — and false in the one case that matters, a request straight to the
origin. Measured: 70 requests against a 60-a-minute cap, a different forged value on each,
all 70 answered. The other half of the same function was as bad in the opposite direction:
with no proxy at all neither header exists, `clientIp` returned the string `unknown`, and
every visitor shared one bucket — one person searching rate-limited the whole site, measured
at request 16 of 70 from a second client.

The socket peer is the ground truth and `Bun.serve` reports it, so that is what is counted. A
proxy header is believed when the connection came from loopback or a private address — nginx
on the same box, which is every layout in [`docs/self-host.md`](docs/self-host.md) — or when
**`TRUST_PROXY=1`** says the hop in front is somewhere public. Existing installs need no
change.

### A reader whose machine is dark opened every page on a white one

There was no `prefers-color-scheme` rule anywhere in the public stylesheet: measured at 0 of
429. `.dark` is applied by a deferred module, so for one paint the page is whatever CSS alone
can decide — and `system` is the default mode. Every dark-mode reader got a white flash on
every navigation.

The dark tokens now ship under `@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root:not([data-theme])}`,
and the island sets `data-theme` to the resolved light/dark on its first apply rather than
only when a reader picks something. Measured after, OS dark and no stored choice: background
`rgb(14,14,14)`, `color-scheme: dark`, identical to what the island later produces. It was
`#fcfcfc`.

The cost is stated rather than glossed: a reader who explicitly chose LIGHT on a dark machine
now gets the inverse flash for exactly as long as the dark reader used to get theirs. That
moves it off the common case onto the rare one. Removing it altogether needs an inline script,
which this project does not have anywhere and asserts it does not.

### The front page lazy-loaded its own LCP image

`front-card.ts` set `loading="lazy"` on every image it built, including the lead's — measured
inside the first screen at both 1000px and 812px viewport heights. Lazy takes the one image
the page is judged by out of the preload scanner's reach. The rule already existed in two
other places; this was the one that had not read it.

### Compressing a response cost more than sending it

`web/compress.ts` runs outside the page cache, so every cache hit re-derived a compressed body
it had already produced. Requests per second on a warm local instance:

| | compression off | re-gzipping | memoised |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Front page | 5,510 | 3,325 | **4,445** |
| Article | 4,897 | 3,509 | **4,943** |
| `site.<hash>.css` | 11,216 | 3,652 | **8,139** |

Compression had been costing 40% of the front page's throughput and two thirds of the
stylesheet's — on a file that is content-hashed, `immutable`, and cannot change for the life of
a build. The cache is keyed by the body's bytes rather than by path, so a write that empties the
page cache has nothing to invalidate here.

A **404 is now compressed**: it is 19,650 bytes of rendered site shell and it is deliberately
not page-cached, so a crawler walking dead links paid for all of it every time. A 206 still is
not, because compressing a slice would make `content-range` a lie.

Brotli was measured and declined: quality 4 saves 2.9% on an article and 1.4% on the admin
sheet for the same CPU or more, to save bytes the CDN re-compresses anyway.

### The owner re-downloaded 262 KB of admin on every load

`main.js` (194 KB) and `admin.css` (68 KB) are the two files the bundler does not hash, and they
went out `no-cache` with no ETag and no Last-Modified — so both came down in full every time,
while the twelve hashed chunks beside them were free. They are fingerprinted now, and the bare
names still serve for a tab holding an older shell.

The shell also linked the entry and nothing else, so the browser discovered the module graph one
level at a time: four waves, measured at 4 / 13 / 24 / 31 ms on localhost, which on a real
connection is four round trips of blank screen. The entry's static imports are walked at startup
and emitted as `modulepreload`; three waves now, and the two that remain are the lazy route and
its dependencies, which is what splitting by route means. Route chunks are deliberately not
preloaded.

None of this reaches a reader. The admin's weight is the owner's alone
([ADR 0006](docs/decisions/0006-admin-stays-react-spa.md)).

### Two things a screen reader got wrong

The search overlay's empty state was a `<p>` inside a `<ul>`. The only child a list may have is
a list item, so a browser drew it correctly and assistive technology announced "list, 0 items"
while a sentence sat on screen saying otherwise. Both messages are list items now, and the list
carries `aria-live="polite"` — results arrive without the focus moving, and nothing had
announced that an answer came back, or that none had.

The theme menu marked the current mode with a CSS class and drew its tick from CSS, so a reader
heard four identical buttons and no way to tell which one they were already on. They are toggle
buttons in a labelled group with `aria-pressed` now — **not** `role="menu"`, which would promise
arrow-key navigation this widget does not implement.

The accessibility pass put `core.js` 59 bytes over its 8,800-byte budget and the guard stopped
the build, which is the guard doing its job. It is at 8,780 and the budget did not move.

### Every webfont rebuilt from upstream

The 2.0.1 subsetting left four families alone. Extending it to them, and moving JetBrains Mono
onto the same upstream path, took **inter −7,572 B** across three subsets and **IBM Plex Mono
−5,564 B** across six.

Source Sans was the last family still carrying `wght 200..900` for a product that offers
400/500/600/700. Clamping the already-shipped file was worth 832 B and had been measured and
dismissed on that basis; from upstream the same clamp is worth **7,076 B**, and the clamped file
covers 20 more codepoints than the one it replaces. All eight families are still offered in
Settings — the two Source faces and Plex Mono were rebuilt rather than dropped.

### Smaller things

- **`docs/performance.md` was split.** It crossed the 400-line cap, so
  [`docs/delivery.md`](docs/delivery.md) now takes what the SERVER does before it answers — the
  render cache, the CDN purge, compression — and `performance.md` stays the resource-loading
  law, what a BROWSER fetches.
- **The README's Speed table was re-measured** against the origin rather than carried forward
  from 2.0.0. Three of five rows were wrong by more than rounding.
- **`bun run build` no longer leaves the tree dirty.** `bun build --compile` drops a 61 MB
  dotfile beside `dist/` that nothing cleans up, and it was untracked and unignored.
- **`TRUST_PROXY` was missing from the Vietnamese README's environment table.** Added with this
  release; it had been documented in English only.
- **The README's headline JavaScript figure contradicted its own Speed table.** It said readers
  download "4.4 KB", fifty lines above a table reading 3.3 and 7.6 — 4.4 KB was `post.js` on its
  own, a bundle rather than anything a page costs, and it survived 2.0.1 re-measuring the table
  underneath it. Both READMEs now give the range a page actually costs, and the artefact rows
  are read off this build: **3.4 KB** on a listing, **7.7 KB** on an article.

### The demo

Not the product, but it is where most people meet it, so it is in the release.
[demo.quireink.com](https://demo.quireink.com) went from **18 posts to 28**, and the owner-facing
half stopped being photographs of absence: nothing had been in Trash, the Media library was a
drop zone, the subscriber list said "No subscribers yet", and no post was waiting anywhere for
the scheduled publishing that is a headline feature.

The fixture also had a claim problem. It shipped with four highlights, three footnotes, one
callout and one equation across eighteen posts — no code fence and no table anywhere — which is
how a site that renders maths, code, tables and five callout types came to look like a site that
renders paragraphs. Each new post is written around one of those gaps.

Its dates follow the clock now instead of a pinned constant, so the demo no longer ages a month
between refreshes; `SEED_NOW` pins them for the README plates, which were themselves pictures of
the fixture from two releases ago and have been reshot.

## 2026-08-07 — Quire Ink 2.0.1

**The product has a name, a licence and three features it did not have on 2026-07-30.** Sixty-nine
commits. Most of them are fixes, and nearly every fix in the list below was found the same way:
by driving the running site in headless Chromium and measuring it, rather than by reading the
source. `check:all` is 1,273 tests, 7 static guards and 45 golden fixtures compared byte for byte.

A reader on a default install with code in the post downloads **28% less font** than they did
on 2.0.0, and nothing was removed from the product to get there.

The entry dated 2026-07-31 below is part of this release.

### It is called Quire Ink now

`quireink.com` was bought, so [ADR 0016](docs/decisions/0016-rename-to-quire-ink.md) moved the
name with the domain and **[demo.quireink.com](https://demo.quireink.com)** became a public demo
instance — `manhhung.me` had been doubling as the showroom. The wordmark is **quireINK**, shipped
as outlines in `src/brand-art.ts`: `quire` in Inter, `INK` in JetBrains Mono, the project's own
two-face system stated as a logo. Outlines rather than live text for three reasons, only the
first aesthetic — `/login` must not wait for a font, the admin renders in whatever chrome face
the owner picked, and Literata is absent from most pages. `Qi` is the compact mark for the app
icon, the favicon and the collapsed rail; both are generated from one module, so the icon cannot
go stale again the way it had (it still read `vb`, two renames back, because nobody opens a 512px
file).

Three names deliberately did not move: `quire.db` and `analytics.db` (renaming them breaks every
backup archive already written), the `__Host-` session cookie (renaming it signs everybody out on
deploy), and the systemd unit.

### Licence: MIT → PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0

MIT grants the right to sell, which was never the intent.
[ADR 0015](docs/decisions/0015-relicense-polyform-noncommercial.md) records the change and the
dependency audit behind it (331 packages, all copyleft-compatible, so AGPL stays available).
Use, modification, redistribution and a patent grant are kept for **any noncommercial purpose**,
read generously: your own blog, a hobby project, study, research, charities, schools, public
research bodies, government. Commercial use is outside the grant and needs a separate licence.

Quire Ink is therefore **source-available, not open source**, and every claim to the contrary in
the tree was corrected rather than softened.

**Not retroactive, and it cannot be.** Everything through `v2.0.0` was MIT and stays MIT for any
copy already taken.

### Mathematics

`$$M \times V = P \times Q$$` used to publish those characters verbatim: the dollar sign means
nothing in Markdown, so `marked` passed it through. [ADR 0020](docs/decisions/0020-mathematics-as-mathml.md).

**Temml renders the TeX to MathML on the server, so a reader downloads nothing extra for it** —
no script, no stylesheet, no font file. That is the only affordable answer against a whole-site
budget of 4.4 KB: KaTeX ships ~23 KB of CSS plus a font family before it draws a glyph, and
MathJax runs in the reader's browser. KaTeX's own `output: 'mathml'` was the near-miss — that
mode was built as an accessibility track beside the HTML it actually draws, and standalone it
renders visibly worse.

`$…$` carries **Pandoc's three guards**, and on a blog that writes about money they are the
load-bearing part: the first post that needed this was about the quantity theory of money, where
`$5` and `$10` sit in the same paragraph as `$M \times V$`. A naive `\$(.+?)\$` reads `5 và ` as
a formula and eats the prose between two prices. Every rejected sentence is a test.

**The editor half was not optional.** With the server renderer complete, opening a post and
saving it still doubled every backslash (`$$M \times V$$` → `$$M \\times V$$`) and ate `\(…\)`
delimiters to markdown-it's `escape` rule. Neither throws; both destroy the author's source on a
save they did not know was a rewrite.

Two toolbar buttons, not one behind a menu — a standalone equation and a symbol inside a sentence
are different gestures. Typing `\(x\)` or `$$x$$` converts on the spot; **`$…$` deliberately does
not**, because an input rule fires on text already typed and cannot see the character coming
next, which is exactly what Pandoc's third guard needs. A price must survive being typed.

### A highlighter pen

Bold and italic mark a word; a blockquote marks a block. Nothing marked the gesture in between —
the one mark on a page that is a **reader's** rather than a typesetter's. `==text==` is that, and
`==text==#green` picks one of five inks. [ADR 0018](docs/decisions/0018-highlighter-pen.md).

The stroke is an SVG image, not a gradient and **not a mask**: masking clips the text along with
the ink, and the first pass sheared the tops off a line of accented text. Two paths per stroke,
chisel ends, and `box-decoration-break: clone` so a highlight running past the end of a line
breaks into one stroke per line instead of a box wrapped around both.

The five pigments are **measured off a photograph of a real pen box**, then verified by reading
pixels back off the rendered page. The pen is chartreuse (hue 73), not the golden yellow the
obvious guess reaches for. Dark mode failed AA twice before it worked. Whole cost: **1.4 KB gzip**,
and the default stroke emits no bytes at all.

### A composed front page

[ADR 0014](docs/decisions/0014-homepage-modes.md), in two parts. `/` can now serve the post list
(the default, byte for byte what it always served), **any page you wrote**, or a **built front
page**: a lead story, a few picks, a row per category, most read, latest.

The design came from photographing the NYT front page rather than remembering it, and the finding
that shaped everything is that **most stories there carry no picture**. Hierarchy is size, then
standfirst, then image, then rules — so the two site kinds are one grammar with the dials moved,
and a site with no images looks finished rather than broken.

Both branches resolve **per request**, not when the routes are registered: `createApp()` runs once
at boot and the mode is a setting, so a route table built from settings would need a restart and
would serve the old shape until it got one.

### The webfonts, rebuilt

Every self-hosted face is rebuilt from upstream by
[`scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py`](scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py), which is committed — the doc
that told you to run this step had been naming a file that has never existed in this tree,
so the one operation the whole font budget rests on was the one nobody could reproduce.
All eight families stay selectable; none was dropped.

**Code ligatures are out of JetBrains Mono, and that is most of the saving.**
`jetbrainsmono-latin` was 30,164 B for 229 characters, and 26 glyphs plus 138 GSUB lookups
of it were the `calt` set: the thing that draws `=>` as an arrow and `!==` as a
struck-through equals **with no exclamation mark left on screen**. Right in an editor,
where you typed the line; wrong on a page, where a reader copies it. `--font-mono` resolves
to this family on every install whatever typeface the owner picked, so any post with code
was paying for it. **30,164 → 14,556 B.**

**Oldstyle figures are back in the two book serifs.** `islands.css.ts` has asked book mode
for `font-feature-settings:"onum" 1,"dlig" 1` since it was written, under a comment saying
a sans would ignore it — and every face ignored it, because the subsetting had dropped
`onum` and `dlig` from Literata and Source Serif alike. The one typographic flourish that
mode advertises had never rendered. Restored to the `latin` subsets only: `onum`
substitutes digits, every ASCII digit is in that range, and asking for it on `latin-ext`
measured +3,700 B of nothing.

**A Vietnamese subset was keeping its diacritics by accident.** `TEXT.vietnamese` declared
no combining marks while `MONO.vietnamese` declared five, and that was not a slicing
detail: GPOS `mark` attachment is what puts a tone mark on a vowel, and a subset with no
mark to attach loses the feature outright. The shipped `latin` files were carrying
U+0300/0301/0303/0309/0323 **outside their own declared range** to cover for it, so the CSS
and the files disagreed in both directions at once. Declared properly, the vietnamese files
keep `mark` and come out smaller. Checked on decomposed (NFD) text, which is what would
have broken.

**Source Sans stops shipping six weights nobody can pick.** It was the one family still
carrying `wght 200..900`; the product offers 400/500/600/700 and nothing else. Rebuilt from
upstream and clamped, `sourcesans-latin` lands under the file it replaces while covering 20
more codepoints — 35,608 B unclamped against 28,532 clamped, from the same source.

| What a reader downloads in fonts | 2.0.0 | 2.0.1 | |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| Default install, English, no code | 36,116 | **33,256** | −8% |
| Default install, English, with code | 66,280 | **47,812** | −28% |
| Default install, Vietnamese, with code | 79,704 | **60,000** | −25% |
| Literata + JetBrains chrome, Vietnamese | 81,948 | **68,212** | −17% |
| Source Sans + Plex Mono, English | 89,232 | **71,668** | −20% |

Across all 21 files on disk: 473,448 → 448,756 B.

Two failures are worth recording, because the script refuses to write on either now. An
explicit `--layout-features` list drops `kern`/`mark`/`mkmk` along with everything else it
does not name: that build measured **26% smaller and had no kerning at all**, and it looked
like a win. And a rebuild that quietly stops covering a declared codepoint is a silent
fallback face for that character, which is how the shipped files came to be missing eleven
of their own.

### The frozen 1.x tree is gone

[ADR 0019](docs/decisions/0019-remove-the-frozen-tree-from-the-working-copy.md). It was 438
tracked files against 434 in `src/`, 495 MB on disk, two guards carrying a special case for it,
and twenty live documents apologising for its paths. **Preserved at tag `v1-final`.** The one-shot
PostgREST importer went with it, along with `@supabase/postgrest-js` and 972 lines of
transform/verify/write — it described a migration that had happened and cannot happen again.
`src/import/wordpress.ts` is unrelated and stays. `golden/v1/corpus/` is **not** part of this: it
is the golden compare's contract, read on every run.

---

### Fixes: things that were losing data or losing readers

- **A partial settings save reset the homepage mode.** Three sanitizers hard-coded their default
  where every sibling honoured the `fallback` argument, and `saveSettings` takes a *partial* — so
  a patch that never mentioned `home` silently moved the homepage back to the post list and
  turned a text-led front page image-led. Reachable, and not by accident: the MCP
  `update_settings` tool builds a patch of at most title, description and `showDescription`.
- **Every redirect the owner had ever stored did nothing.** The table has had full CRUD since the
  port and no reader, so a redirect created in Settings → SEO appeared in the list and never
  fired — and the automatic 301 a slug rename adds never fired either. **Every rename since the
  port quietly threw away the old URL and whatever ranked at it.**
- **A trailing slash was a 404.** No route ends in a slash and Hono does not match one, so
  `/some-post/` fell through everything. Fine for a URL somebody typed; fatal for a site that
  *moved* here, because every WordPress permalink carries one. Measured on a real export: 468 old
  URLs shaped `https://example.com/{slug}/`, every one of them answering 404.
- **Redirects pointed at `http://` behind a proxy.** TLS terminates at nginx, so the origin sees
  `http` and every `Location` was resolved against that. A browser paid an extra hop; a client
  that refuses https → http simply stopped. The test asserted the absolute form, which is why it
  shipped.
- **A save landing mid-warm never purged the CDN.** `warmThenPurge` opened with `if (running)
  return`, which reads like de-duplication and is data loss: a warm walks every public post and
  measured 8.4s on a 77-post site, so any save inside that window never reached `purgeEdge`.
  Measured `Age: 824` against an `s-maxage` of 60.
- **A 500 on any public page** returned `{"error":"Internal error"}` in the browser window —
  unstyled, no viewport meta, no way back. The three locale strings for a real error page had
  been in all six languages since the port with nothing printing them.
- **A miss on any path of two segments or more** fell through to Hono's built-in `404 Not Found`
  in `text/plain`. `/{slug}` answers a one-segment miss properly, so the only case anyone checked
  always looked right — while an imported WordPress site sends every old inbound link shaped
  `/2024/01/slug` straight here.

### Fixes: the reading surface

- **A five-column table panned the whole article sideways on a phone.** Measured at 390px: a
  table is 484px at its narrowest and cannot be squeezed below its own content, so the document
  went to 516px and every paragraph travelled with it. `pre` has carried `overflow-x` since it
  was written and `.math-block` was given it deliberately; tables were the third case, and two
  comments in the tree asserted they already scrolled.
- **A phone gave a sixth of its width to gutters and got half the measure.** The shell padded
  2rem a side at every width, and above the phone breakpoint that is dead weight because the
  42rem max-width binds first — so it only ever spent anything where there was nothing spare. At
  390px the article set **33 characters to the line against 67 on a laptop**. Now 37 and 9 lines
  where it was 33 and 10; a 360px Android goes 30 to 33.
- **The newspaper filed its lead stories two levels below the section names.** The outline read
  h1, h3, h3, h3, h2. Size comes from a class and never from the tag, which is also why no
  screenshot was ever going to catch it.
- **The section headings missed the mono-chrome tracking correction.** Under a JetBrains Mono
  chrome the word "Typography" set 90.2px as a section label and 82.7px as the kicker three lines
  below it. Same font, same size, same screen, 9% apart.
- **Every palette was tuned to land exactly on the contrast minimum**, and one landed on it to
  the decimal — ocean's meta measured 4.50:1 against AA's 4.50. All six clear **5.0:1** now,
  which is the bar this repository already holds its own highlighter to. The corrections are
  three to six hex points each. A new test computes the ratio for every role in every preset.
- **The front page's own links were 20px tall** against the 24px minimum, on a phone, where the
  mobile sheet already gave the drawer rows, the tag links and the footer a real target.
- **A teaser ended on "a field of…"** — an ellipsis after a preposition. It prefers a full stop
  now when one falls in the last 40% of the budget. No stop-word list: this product ships a UI in
  six languages, and a full stop is punctuation rather than vocabulary.
- **A site with a dark logo had no logo at all in dark mode.** The rule hiding the light mark
  matched both marks and won on specificity. It shipped because the path had never rendered —
  `logoDark` is opt-in and no instance had set one.
- **The grid toggle was visible on every page that has no list**, announcing
  `aria-pressed="false"` for a list that was not there. `[hidden]` is a general rule now, not a
  patch per component.
- **The mobile sidebar drawer panned 32px on every phone** (2026-07-31, below).
- The comment thread became a card on the page's own terms, with the body set at the article
  size instead of two steps smaller, and a date that comes before its time in every locale —
  Vietnamese had been rendering `lúc 21:58 23 tháng 6, 2026`.
- Links prefetch eagerly; prerender stays on hover. Measured from a Vietnamese home connection:
  TTFB is ~145ms on an edge hit, ~185ms on a miss, ~65ms straight to the origin, and `moderate`
  prerender needs a ~200ms hover dwell that a normal click never waits for.

### Fixes: the share card

- **A Japanese title came back as twenty black boxes reading NO GLYPH.** satori has no system
  fallback and returns a perfectly valid PNG of the right size, so nothing failed: the route
  answered 200 and every structural assertion passed. The card ships three Inter subsets, so ja,
  ko, zh, ru, el, th and ar were all reaching it — and the first three are configurations this
  product explicitly supports. Both builders check every line they would draw now, and fall back
  to the site's own image or to no card. Shipping a CJK face is megabytes and stays an open
  decision rather than something slipped into a bug fix.
- **The card was a dark gradient with white text**, which is what every generated card on the web
  looks like and which said nothing about what was on the other side of the link. It is paper
  now, with the title and the date under the **same highlighter** the reader meets inside an
  article. Rasterised at 2x — satori emits SVG, so the resolution was always sharp's to choose,
  and 72 DPI left the type soft on the phone where a shared link is opened.
- **The pen on the card was not the pen on the page.** A copy of the stroke had drifted from the
  original — the denser lower band ended four numbers apart — under a comment claiming a test
  pinned the two together. There was no such test. `render/pen.ts` holds the pen now, and the
  card's own pixels are asserted.

### Fixes: import, security, abuse

- **A WordPress gallery lost most of its photographs.** The figure rule read
  `querySelector('img')`, which is the first match anywhere in the subtree, and returned it as
  the replacement for the whole block: importing a real site brought over **255 of its 407
  photographs** and said nothing. One page kept 30 of 169.
- **`collapseBlob` stripped `/uploads/` anywhere it appeared**, so an imported post referencing
  another site's `/wp-content/uploads/x.jpg` was silently rewritten to `/wp-contentx.jpg` on save.
- **Every never-published WordPress draft imported dated today**, because WordPress writes a zero
  GMT date and `??` took the zero.
- **`/og` was the expensive public route and the only one without a cap.** A cached page answers
  in ~1ms; a card costs ~44ms, and the card is a pure function of its query string — so changing
  one character of `?title=` misses the edge and the origin together. At 40 concurrent from one
  unauthenticated client the median page went from 1.9ms to 10.6ms on a machine with cores to
  spare; the self-hosting target is a 1–2 vCPU box.
- Two dead-end code-scanning findings closed for real (a drifted HTML escaper in the newsletter,
  biased sampling in recovery codes) and one documented as dismissed with the reason.

### The repository stopped describing one blog

`state/` was a worklog, a task list, a roadmap and five audits — all public, all about **one**
blog: its domain, its server, its service name, what was wrong with it on five dates. None of it
was a credential and none of it was a leak. It was somebody else's server, published for no
benefit to any reader. It moved to a private sibling with the two vhosts that named a domain, a
cert path and an internal port ([ADR 0017](docs/decisions/0017-move-state-and-instance-config-private.md)).
The backup script stopped being named after one instance, `backups.md` stopped citing the
author's own post count as evidence, and the delivered plan stopped declaring "there are no
third-party self-hosters" — a sentence every clause of which had become false.

Also: **794 generated files untracked** (12.5 MB of design-sync output swept in by a `git add -A`),
the parity checklist's 232 never-ticked boxes replaced by an inventory that reads as one, and
`docs/features.md` split into a directory at its cap.

### Guards

- **`check:docs` gained a sixth rule**: a repository path written as code in a live document has
  to exist. Rule 1 only ever resolved links *between* markdown files, which is how CLAUDE.md's
  debug router — the first thing anyone opens when something breaks — spent months pointing at
  two source files that are not there. It immediately found worse: `self-host.md` documented a
  migration command deleted a release earlier, and `performance.md` told you to run a script that
  has never been in this tree.
- **`check:admin-kit`** is new: each admin primitive has a signature belonging to exactly one
  file, and the check fails if a screen re-types it.
- **`check:css-literal` and `check:type-roles` discover their sheets** instead of listing them.
  Both lists had gone stale — `front.css.ts` and `utility.css.ts` were never in one of them, so
  it reported "ok (6 sheets)" against files it had never opened.
- **`noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`** on in all three projects: 15 dead declarations,
  three dead exports, and **336 dead locale strings** across twelve files.
- `check:filesize` and `check:docs` warn from 90–95% of a cap, so the person who adds the line
  that crosses it is not the person blocked by it.

## 2026-07-31 — the mobile sidebar stopped panning

**The drawer scrolled sideways by 32px on every phone, and two separate mistakes had to line
up for it.** `.rail` asks for `overflow-y:auto` so a long index can scroll. A box that names
one axis and leaves the other alone does not get `visible` on the other — the used value
computes to `auto` — so the drawer had been a horizontal scroller all along, waiting for
something inside it to be a pixel too wide.

The IDE chrome then supplied the pixel. Its line-number ring hangs 23px outside a rail row, on
the gutter rail's divider hairline, and `.rail-inner` was widened by 32px and padded back so
the gutter's own scroller could not clip it. Both of those are facts about the **desktop**
rail: below 640px the rail is a drawer with no divider and no inner scroller, and `rail-css.ts`
injects that scroller inside the same breakpoint. Ungated, the overhang put a 291px box inside
a 259px one. The whole IDE rail block is now behind `@media (min-width:640px)`, which is where
the header already drops its tokens, and `.rail` spells out `overflow-x:hidden` so no future
rule can teach it to pan again.

Measured, not eyeballed: `nav.toc.rail` reported `clientWidth 299` against `scrollWidth 331`
before, and no horizontal scroller at all after, at 360, 390 and 414px. The page itself never
overflowed, which is why this survived the mobile pass in 2.0.0 — `documentElement.scrollWidth`
was 390 the whole time and the panning was one element deep.

**Also:** four new demo images in the README, rebuilt from real screenshots of a seeded
English instance and composed in HTML so they regenerate from a command. The dashboard shot
is what surfaced the activity-row overlap fixed in 2.0.0.

## 2026-07-30 — Quire 2.0.0

**Stable.** The beta said it had run one site for one owner for a little over a day, and that
nothing was known to be broken but nothing had been proven either. Since then the whole project
has been audited end to end — design, performance, and correctness — by measuring the running
site rather than reading the source. That audit found one live security hole, one rendering
rule that had never applied, and a mobile failure no amount of source reading would have
revealed. All three are fixed and verified in production. That is the difference between
beta.1 and 2.0.0.

### The shape of it

One process, two SQLite files, a directory of uploads. Clone it, `bun install`, run
`bun src/index.ts` behind a reverse proxy, and the install is done. There is no database server
to provision, no migration step (the schema is applied at boot inside a transaction), no
container runtime, and no third-party account anywhere in the path. Docker is one service and
two volumes, with no sidecar.

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Runtime** | Bun + Hono. One process, single-threaded, so exactly one writer by construction: no pool, no mutex, no busy-retry |
| **Content** | `quire.db` and `analytics.db`, joined with `ATTACH` where needed. Timestamps are integer milliseconds UTC everywhere; timezone logic lives in TypeScript, never in SQL |
| **Public pages** | Server-rendered HTML plus three hand-written island scripts. **No framework reaches a reader** |
| **Admin** | A React 19 SPA, route-split, served only to the owner. React and the editor cannot leak onto a reading page |
| **Uploads** | The local filesystem, with AVIF and WebP variants built on save |

The seams are enforced rather than remembered. `bun run check:all` runs the type checker over
three projects, **six static guards** and **1,121 tests**. The guards fail the build on: a file
over 400 lines, a hardcoded size in the reader's stylesheet (or a type role that sets a size
without its leading and tracking), a backtick or an unopened comment inside a CSS template
literal, a NUL byte in a source file, a stale documentation link, and **any write route
registered outside the owner-gated router group** — the last one caught a forgotten
`/api/auth/enrol/done` the first time it ran.

### What a reader actually downloads

Measured from the network on a cold load of the live site, not estimated from the markup:

| | Home | A post |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Requests | **11** | **12** |
| Total | **139 KB** | **140 KB** |
| of&nbsp;which&nbsp;fonts | 86 KB | 86 KB |
| HTML | 22 KB | 18 KB |
| CSS | 7.6 KB | 7.6 KB |
| JavaScript | **4.4 KB** | **9.7 KB** |
| Third-party&nbsp;requests | **0** | **0** |

Everything except the HTML is content-hashed and `immutable` for a year, so a second page view
costs about **23 KB**. The reading fonts are 62% of a first visit, and that is a deliberate
trade: they are self-hosted, subset per language and `opsz`-pinned, because typography is the
product on a reading site.

The JavaScript figure is the one worth staring at. A listing page ships 4.4 KB — the analytics
beacon, the theme control, the search trigger and the mobile drawer — and an article adds the
table of contents, the lightbox, the code-copy button and book mode for another 5 KB. Each
bundle has a **byte budget the build enforces**, so a feature that overruns it fails the build
instead of quietly costing every reader.

Where the speed comes from:

- **One in-process page cache**, cleared completely on any write, so the invalidation rule is
  one line long and cannot rot. A miss is a sub-millisecond SQLite read plus a render.
- **A content-addressed render cache** in SQLite for markdown and syntax highlighting: the
  input IS the key, so there is no invalidation problem at all. It took long-post rendering
  from 383 ms to 1 ms, and it now prunes itself from the hourly tick.
- **The public stylesheet is minified before it is hashed.** It was 65,645 bytes of which
  34,438 were comment text, because these sheets are commented the way the code is. The prose
  stays in the `.ts` file; the wire gets 30,811 bytes, **6.5 KB compressed against 20.9 KB**.
- **Reading-font subsets are preloaded by language**, with `latin-ext` left lazy behind
  `unicode-range` and the chrome face preloaded only when it is a self-hosted family that
  reflows the page. Pinning the `opsz` axis took the preload set this site actually serves
  from **97,588 bytes to 46,212** — 51 KB off the critical path, measured.
- **Origin compression, edge caching, and prerender-on-hover** through a `Speculation-Rules`
  header rather than an inline script, so the public site ships no inline script at all and the
  recommended CSP can keep refusing `unsafe-inline`.
- **Scroll-driven CSS animations** for the card reveal and the reading progress bar: no script,
  off the main thread, and triple-gated so they can only ever hide content where they can also
  reveal it.

### Since the beta

**A live reflected XSS, found and closed.** `web/search-page.ts` had grown a private
`escapeHtml` that escaped `& < >` and nothing else, and it interpolated the reader's query into
`value="…"`. So `/search?q=" onfocus=alert(1) autofocus x="` came back as a working event
handler on a public page, from a link anybody could send. Escaping `<` meant a script tag could
not be injected; the unescaped quote was all it took. Both files that put a value in an
attribute through a weak escaper now use the canonical pair from `utils.ts`, which escapes both
quote forms, and `escapeAttr` is exported as a named alias so a call site reads as the context
it writes into. Two regression tests assert on the attribute's own quote count rather than on
the payload's text.

**A mobile layout that scrolled sideways, and the cause was not CSS.** Every public miss
returned `text/plain`, and a plain-text body carries no viewport meta, so a phone laid two words
out at the default 980px desktop width and let the reader pan. Measured at 390px: an unknown
slug reported a 980px document while every real page reported 390. The strings for a proper 404
page had been sitting in all six locales since the port with nothing rendering them. Every HTML
miss is now a page in the site shell.

**A rule that had never applied since the feature shipped.** Minifying the stylesheet surfaced a
paragraph in `ide.css.ts` with a closing `*/` and no opener: a browser read the prose as a
selector, failed, and discarded the rule that followed it — seven selectors meant to darken every
count and date under the IDE chrome. `check:css-literal` counts comment delimiters now.

**Mobile, measured at 360, 390 and 414 px and in landscape.** The search form was missing the
`min-width: 0` its sibling form had, so the input would not shrink and pushed the button's
border off-screen. Drawer rows went from 22px to 43px, the tag cloud to 37px, footer links to
35px. Form controls are floored at 16px on phone widths, because below that iOS zooms the page
on focus, and confirmed still 14.08px at desktop width so the floor does not leak. Copy-code is
visible under `@media (hover:none)`, the drawer has a scrim, `100dvh` sits beside `100vh`, and
the safe-area insets are honoured. All of it lives in a fourth sheet, `mobile.css.ts`, appended
last and matching nothing above 639px.

**The editor stops losing work.** A hard downward scroll triggered the browser's pull-to-refresh
and reloaded the page; the admin sets `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` now. The local snapshot
ran only on an 8-second timer, and `beforeunload` does not reliably fire on a mobile reload, so
it was never the safety net it looked like: it is flushed on `pagehide`, on a
`visibilitychange` to hidden, and on unmount.

**Contrast, discovery and keyboard.** `.term-count` measured 2.26:1 and failed AA at any size,
visible only with the IDE chrome switched off — so the site the owner saw was never the one
shipping the failure. Book mode's meta colour was 3.30:1 on its paper and is 4.93:1 now.
`/feed.xml` answered correctly with nothing on the site pointing at it; there is a
`rel="alternate"` link. A skip link is the first tab stop on every public page, and one
`:focus-visible` ring replaces the `outline: none` that had made the sign-up field the only
control where keyboard focus vanished.

**Admin.** The top progress bar drew itself twice per click: a navigation has two halves, the
route's chunk resolving and then the new page asking for its data, and the bar took the few
frames between them literally, marked itself done and restarted from the left. Measured at
39 ms and again at 102 ms; now one sweep. Toasts are announced to a screen reader and carry a
glyph, since success and failure had been inverted black and white and nothing else. The
`danger` button variant was byte-identical to `primary`, which made "Delete forever" the loudest
control on its screen. On the dashboard, an activity row gave its action a flat 120px column and
no way to shrink, so the long names — `auth.recovery.regenerated` measures 176px — ran out of
their track and painted on top of the detail beside them.

**Correctness and cleanup.** `safeNext` rejected `//host` but not `/\host`, which browsers
normalise into a protocol-relative URL and follow off-site. A second Cloudflare purge
implementation with no request timeout was deleted and its three callers repointed. `og.ts` no
longer trusts a `Host` header when `SITE_URL` is unset, and both of its fetches are bounded. The
render cache was insert-only with nothing ever deleting; it prunes in bounded batches, with no
`VACUUM`, because the database runs in WAL. Feeds and the public search index stop rebuilding at
the origin on every hit. A dead module, five dead exports, four orphaned routes and two unused
dependencies are gone, and the two modules that did arithmetic and sent mail — the analytics
aggregation and the comment-reply notifier — have tests for the first time.

### Moving from Quire 1.x

Everything about *running* it changed; nothing about *using* it did. The full breaking list is
in the 2026-07-29 entry below; the short version:

- **Sign-in is yours.** Google and NextAuth are gone: username + password (argon2id) + required
  TOTP + ten single-use recovery codes. `bun run user create` makes the account.
- **No database server.** `POSTGREST_URL` / `POSTGREST_TOKEN` no longer exist; `DATA_DIR` holds
  both database files.
- **Four environment variables matter.** Everything else is entered in the admin.
- **Import your 1.x content** with `bun run import-v1`, which reads a running 1.x over
  PostgREST. What was deliberately not carried over, with reasons, is in
  `docs/spec/07-parity.md`: Google Drive backup, numbered pagination,
  the reader-facing palette switcher, grid-view thumbnails.

The rewrite was a **port, not a reimplementation**
([ADR 0005](docs/decisions/0005-rewrite-in-bun-hono-sqlite.md)). Roughly 6,500 lines of logic
and every test moved unchanged, and the article renderer is held byte-for-byte against 1.x by a
golden corpus that treats one differing byte as a porting mistake, with nothing to review and
nothing to accept.

### Known gaps

- **The compiled binary is not the shipping path yet.** `bun run build` produces `dist/quire`,
  one file, but `bun build --compile` does not bundle `sharp`'s native module, so it throws the
  first time it resizes an image. Run from source, which is what the live site does. Tracked in
  `state/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
- No in-app restore, by design: restoring replaces database files the process holds open. Backup
  is a one-click download from the admin plus an off-box cron job. See
  [`docs/backups.md`](docs/backups.md).
- Numbered pagination is prev/next only; the reader-facing palette switcher and grid-view
  thumbnails were not ported.
- The autosave interval is a constant, and the editor never says the work is being held locally.
  Both are filed in `state/TASKS.md`.
- Ten renderers still declare a private HTML escaper. Every attribute interpolation in them was
  verified to use the strong `escapeAttr`, so what is left is tidying rather than a hole, and the
  article renderer's text escaper is deliberately frozen by the golden gate.

## 2026-07-29 — Quire 2.0 beta (v2.0.0-beta.1)

The first tagged 2.0. The rewrite has been serving `manhhung.me` since 2026-07-28; this is
the point at which the two features it shipped WITHOUT are in, the last of the port's quiet
losses are found, and the version stops being `2.0.0-dev`.

**Beta and not 2.0.0**, for one honest reason: it has run one site for one owner for a
little over a day. Nothing is known to be broken. Nothing has been proven by anyone else
either.

### The two dead controls are alive

- **Google sign-in for commenters** ([ADR 0013](docs/decisions/0013-google-sign-in-for-commenters.md)).
  The toggle sat in Settings controlling nothing, and the parity note recorded the removal
  citing ADR 0007 — which is about the OWNER'S sign-in and says nothing about readers. A
  commenter is now a signed `__Host-` cookie rather than a session row; the identity comes
  from the id_token's claims (`aud`, `iss`, `exp`, `email_verified`) and the request body is
  ignored. Client id and secret are entered in the admin.
- **Scheduled backups** now write snapshots to `BACKUP_DIR` from the cron tick, listed,
  downloadable and deletable in the admin, retention by count. Due-ness is read from the
  newest file on disk, so there is no state to go stale. There is deliberately no restore
  button: restoring replaces database files the process holds open.

### Found by measuring, not by reading

Each of these looked correct in the source.

- **Prerender on hover.** `docs/performance.md` described Speculation Rules as shipping and
  the spec asked for them; neither was true. What the port DID carry over was
  `whenActivated`, the guard that exists only because a prerendered page runs its JS early.
  Now shipped as a `Speculation-Rules` header rather than an inline script, so the public
  site still ships none and the CSP keeps refusing `unsafe-inline`.
- **Typography.** A related-post title had no size rule at all and fell back to the body
  size. `--type-scale` was spelled per rule, so book mode enlarged the prose and left
  figcaptions, tags and the comment thread behind. The comment thread had lost
  `font-family: var(--font-reading)` and was rendering in the chrome font. Nine literal
  sizes sat in a sheet whose own header forbids them — `bun run check:type` now fails the
  build on any of it.
- **The series card** had lost the link to its own `/series/<slug>` page (which nothing on
  the site reached), the "part N of M" line, and its position above the article. All three
  were restored from data the port was already carrying.
- **The admin dashboard** reported `PostgreSQL · online` on a SQLite install, and its
  version named no build. It now shows the commit and links to it.

### Also

- Series in the sidebar, under the categories, with counts. `features.sidebarSeries`.
- Turnstile and Google sign-in moved to **Settings → Connections**, toggle and keys
  together. The split is what let `googleAuth` stay on for weeks with nothing behind it.
- A dark-mode logo can be uploaded; both marks ship and CSS picks, because the page cache is
  keyed by URL alone.
- The admin's dark mode works: `@custom-variant dark` was missing, and under it a `<body>`
  with a background and no text colour.
- First schema migration mechanism. `schema.sql` states the final shape; `migrations.sql`
  gets an existing database there.
- `scripts/ops/quire2-backup.sh` no longer names one machine's paths, bucket and webhook.

### Known gaps

- Numbered pagination is prev/next only; the palette switcher and grid-view thumbnails were
  not ported. Full list in `state/TASKS.md`.
- CI is red: the workflow still runs `npm ci` against a repository that has had no
  `package-lock.json` since the cutover. The fix is written and needs a token with
  `workflow` scope to land.
- No in-app restore, by design. See `docs/backups.md`.

## 2026-07-29 — Quire 2.0: one process, two SQLite files, no infrastructure

**The whole thing was rewritten and `manhhung.me` has been serving it since 2026-07-28.**
Next.js 16 + React + PostgreSQL + PostgREST became **Bun + Hono + SQLite**: one process,
two database files, a directory of uploads. Nothing to provision, nothing to keep running
beside it, no third-party account anywhere in the path.

It is a **port, not a reimplementation** ([ADR 0005](docs/decisions/0005-rewrite-in-bun-hono-sqlite.md)).
Roughly 6,500 lines of pure logic and every test moved unchanged; the admin's 68 React
components moved almost verbatim. That was the point: the owner does not read code, so the
dominant risk was a behaviour quietly not surviving the move, and translation is where
behaviour goes missing.

### ⚠️ Breaking — everything about running it

- **Sign-in is now yours.** Google and NextAuth are gone. Username + password (argon2id) +
  **required TOTP** + ten single-use recovery codes ([ADR 0007](docs/decisions/0007-self-hosted-password-totp-auth.md)).
  Create the account with `bun run user create --username <name> --email <address>`.
  `AUTHORIZED_EMAIL`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_*` and `AUTH_URL` no longer exist.
- **No database server.** `POSTGREST_URL` / `POSTGREST_TOKEN` are gone. `DATA_DIR` holds
  `quire.db` and `analytics.db`; the schema is applied at boot inside a transaction, so
  there is no migration step.
- **Env is down to four things that matter**: `DATA_DIR`, `SITE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`,
  `STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR`. Everything else is entered in the admin.
- **Google Drive backup is gone** ([parity exception 1](docs/spec/00-rationale.md)). Backup is
  now an operational job that keeps working when the application does not: a cron script
  to object storage, plus a one-click download of the whole install from the admin. That
  deleted ~730 lines of OAuth, token refresh and folder bookkeeping. See [docs/backups.md](docs/backups.md).
- **Sessions do not carry over.** The cookie is `__Host-` prefixed and therefore scoped to
  one hostname. You will sign in again.

### The reader's side

- The public site now ships **no framework at all**: server-rendered HTML plus a few small
  hand-written islands, and **no inline script anywhere** — a property covered by a test,
  which is what lets the CSP drop `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src`.
- Article HTML is **byte-identical** to 1.5's. The golden harness became a hard equality
  gate rather than a diff review, because `marked` and `shiki` came along unchanged.
- **Book reading mode** paginates correctly: 1.5 drifted one column gap on every page turn.
- Search runs on SQLite FTS5 with Vietnamese diacritics folded.
- **A dark logo can be uploaded** (Settings → Site). A logo is ink on transparency and a
  dark mark measures about 3.4:1 on a dark page, which reads as a black smudge. Both marks
  are emitted and CSS picks one, because the page cache is keyed by URL alone.
- `cache-control` is sent for the first time: 60 seconds plus `stale-while-revalidate` on
  public HTML, `private, no-store` on the admin, sign-in and API.

### The owner's side

- The admin is the same React SPA, extracted from Next and served as a static bundle
  ([ADR 0006](docs/decisions/0006-admin-stays-react-spa.md)). Settings were regrouped into
  seven defined tabs ([ADR 0011](docs/decisions/0011-settings-regrouped-into-seven.md)).
- **Dark mode actually works.** It was applying to four elements and nothing else: Tailwind
  v4 compiles `dark:` to a media query unless told otherwise, so 668 utilities were
  following the operating system while the admin's own switch toggled a class nobody was
  listening to.
- Tables no longer clip on a phone, and the analytics table no longer spends its width on
  three-character numbers while truncating every title.
- The MCP server, the WordPress import, scheduled publishing, redirects, series, the
  activity log, Trash and the in-app Help all moved across intact.

### Under it

- Two SQLite files joined with `ATTACH`. `bun:sqlite` is synchronous and the runtime is
  single-threaded, so there is exactly one writer by construction: no pool, no mutex, no
  busy-retry.
- The seven invariants were restated for the new shape ([docs/invariants.md](docs/invariants.md)).
  The cache one got blunter on purpose: the whole page cache is thrown away after every
  write, which costs a few renders and cannot be wrong.
- 927 tests. `bun run check:all` is typecheck, four static guards and the suite, offline,
  with no services.
- The repository was flattened after cutover ([ADR 0012](docs/decisions/0012-flatten-repo-after-cutover.md)):
  2.0 at the root, the frozen Next tree in `v1/`.

### Known gaps

- **Google sign-in for commenters is not implemented.** The toggle survived the port and
  the feature did not; it does nothing until it is built.
- The backup schedule and retention fields in Settings are inert for the same reason.
- Numbered pagination is prev/next only, and the palette switcher and grid-view thumbnails
  were not ported (both are off on this install). Full list in `state/TASKS.md`.

## 2026-07-26 — Quire 1.5: newsletter, a real dev stack, and a security pass (v1.5.0)

The minor moves for two reasons: the blog can now **email its readers** as a first-class
subsystem, and the self-host **environment variables were renamed** (see Breaking below).

### ⚠️ Breaking — self-host env

`SUPABASE_URL` → **`POSTGREST_URL`**, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → **`POSTGREST_TOKEN`**,
and **`POSTGREST_DIRECT` is gone**. Rename the two keys in your `.env.local` / `.env.docker`
*before* restarting — `src/env.ts` fails fast, so a server with the old names will not boot.
`POSTGREST_URL` is the endpoint that serves tables at `/<table>`; behind Supabase's gateway
that path is `/rest/v1`, so include the suffix in the URL itself.

The names were a leftover: the data layer used the `supabase-js` client to speak PostgREST,
long after Supabase itself was dropped. It now depends on **`@supabase/postgrest-js`** — the
standalone query builder that `supabase-js` wraps — so `db()` keeps the same `.from()`/`.rpc()`
surface, all 132 call sites across 28 files are unchanged, and four clients the app never
called (auth, realtime, storage, functions) are no longer shipped.

### Newsletter

- **Admin → Newsletter**, a page of its own with three tabs. *People*: subscribers and each
  address's real send history. *Send*: pick one or more posts, review the actual email HTML in
  a sandboxed iframe, then send. *Test*: sample sends. Settings → Integrations now holds only
  the SMTP credentials.
- **Sending is a deliberate act.** There is no automatic broadcast: the cron publishes a
  scheduled post on time but never emails anyone. The double-send guard reads the send log
  rather than `broadcast_at`, which older posts still carry from the retired auto-send.
- **A designed email, in your palette.** One shell for every message — 600px table, inline
  styles, masthead with your actual logo, hidden preheader, an Outlook-safe button, and a
  footer that says why the reader is getting this. Colours come from the owner's own theme.
  The logo ships a **PNG twin** because Outlook on Windows cannot render WebP.
- **Several posts are ONE digest**, never one message per post — newest leads, the rest follow
  as a list. Each post still gets credit in the per-post stats.
- **Every send is logged**, success and failure with the SMTP error, from the single choke
  point in `sendMail` — no path can email an address without it showing up.
- **Open tracking** via a 1×1 pixel whose token identifies the send row, never the address.
  First hit wins; no IP, UA or referrer recorded; previews and test sends carry no token.
  Links are not wrapped — there is no click tracking.
- **Subscribe from any page** with a header envelope button (shown only when SMTP is
  configured) that opens the form as a modal.
- **Unsubscribe now confirms on POST.** A bare `GET` — email scanners, link prefetchers — no
  longer silently unsubscribes someone; it renders a confirmation page instead.

### Security

A dependency audit found **14 known vulnerabilities, 3 critical**, because `next` was pinned
to an exact version and patch releases never arrived. All criticals are gone:

- **Auth.js** — a configuration error could make existence-based auth checks *fail open*, and
  `getToken()` threw on a malformed `Bearer` header (called on every `/admin` and `/api`
  request). → `next-auth` 5.0.0-beta.32 / `@auth/core` 0.41.3
- **Next.js** — middleware/proxy bypass on App Router + Turbopack, plus nine more. → 16.2.11
- **node-tar** — parse DoS and an infinite loop; restore unpacks archives. → 7.5.22
- **fast-xml-parser** — entity-expansion reset, reachable through the WordPress importer. → 5.10.1
- **sharp** / **postcss** — needed `overrides`, because the vulnerable copies were nested
  inside `next` where a normal bump has no effect.
- `nodemailer` deliberately stays on 7.x: none of its advisories touch an API this app uses,
  and `next-auth`'s peer range forbids 9. Reasoning recorded in `audit/2026-07-26-comprehensive.md`.
- **`/api/subscribers` was exempted from the edge owner guard** — `isPublicApi()` matched
  `/api/subscribe` as a prefix. Nothing was exposed (the routes call `requireOwner()`), but
  the defence-in-depth layer is restored and the match is now exact.

### Accessibility

- **All six light palettes failed WCAG AA on secondary text** (2.91:1–3.60:1 where 4.5:1 is
  required at 14px); scifi and amber failed on link colour too. Corrected to the lightest
  value that clears AA, hue and saturation untouched. Live Lighthouse accessibility **96 → 100**.
- `themes.test.ts` now holds every preset to AA — a palette is data, so a bad value is
  invisible in review.

### Performance

- **Font weight axes clamped to 400–700**, the only weights the app can render, keeping the
  `opsz` axis that `font-optical-sizing: auto` opts into. The reading font's LCP pair drops
  **129 KB → 95 KB**; 175 KB saved across the bundled families (`scripts/subset-font-weights.py`).
- Responsive `<picture>` for the cover hero, a lean media select for the public post render
  instead of reading the whole library, and a lazily-loaded search overlay.
- Measured on the live site (mobile, median of three): **Performance 77 → 87, LCP 5.1s → 4.0s,
  blocking time 230ms → 100ms.**

### Working on Quire

- **A local dev stack that actually works**: `docker-compose.dev.yml` brings up Postgres +
  PostgREST + **Mailpit**, so `npm run dev` on the host has hot reload and the whole newsletter
  path — opt-in, broadcast, reply, open pixel — runs end to end with no real SMTP account.
- **`DEV_LOGIN`** adds a local-only owner sign-in, so `/admin` is reachable on a machine with
  no Google credentials. It is an auth bypass, so it has two gates and an alarm: unregistered
  unless `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, it demands a secret rather than being a flag, and a
  production server **refuses to boot** while it is set.
- **Admin → Help rebuilt as a usable manual.**
- Verification is now a rule, not a habit: run the change on the local stack and drive it with
  a headless browser. Two UI defects shipped the week before purely because `check:all` passed
  and nobody opened the page.
- The static check scripts normalise path separators, so the guards work on Windows — they had
  been reporting phantom violations and silently skipping their own exemption lists.

### Fixes

- **Lightbox was dead for self-hosted images** — the URL scan only matched absolute `https://`,
  while local images are stored root-relative, so the island never rendered.
- **WordPress import** stamps imported posts as already broadcast, so a later cron tick cannot
  blast an entire back catalogue to subscribers.
- **Book mode**: wide images spilled into the next column; dark mode leaked white text onto the
  paper background (the overrides used the wrong variable prefix).
- **Admin analytics scrolled sideways on a phone** — the header held its actions rigid, so four
  range pills plus Export could neither shrink nor wrap.
- File uploads use an exclusive write with retry, matching media originals.
- Search box is one bordered field with no stray accent ring; the rightmost header icon aligns
  to the content margin.
- Scroll-reveal now works on Safari and Firefox via an IntersectionObserver fallback (Chromium
  keeps the pure-CSS path and ships no extra JS), and the fade finishes mid-screen where the
  eye actually is.

### Look

- The public frontend is rounded site-wide, matching the admin, instead of the global
  square-corner reset.
- Admin dropdowns are styled: a custom `Select` replaces the raw native control, and a
  `Combobox` replaces the untypeable `<input list>` + `<datalist>`.
- Shared input chrome, aligned radii, and the analytics read-depth panel moved up beside
  Channels and Referrers.

## 2026-07-23 — book mode: 15% larger text + paler paper (v1.4.37)

- Reading text in book mode is now 15% larger than normal, via a `--type-scale` multiplier on
  the `--fs-*` role sizes (default 1 elsewhere). It tracks the owner's font-size setting: raise
  the setting and book mode stays 15% above it. UI chrome (fixed rem) is unchanged.
- Book-mode paper background is a touch paler.

## 2026-07-23 — book mode: single paper background (v1.4.36)

- Dropped the floating page-sheet-on-desk look: book mode is now ONE flat warm-paper
  background across the whole reader (no two-tone surface, no sheet shadow).
- Paper grain is baked into that single background (desaturated fractal noise, multiplied)
  and dialled up a touch so the texture reads more clearly.

## 2026-07-23 — book mode split out + excerpt-tracking fix (v1.4.35)

- **Fix — cramped post-card excerpts:** the mono-chrome letter-spacing nudge
  (`data-chrome-font` −0.04/−0.05em) was leaking onto `.reading-font` excerpts (they wear
  `.t-body`), tightening the reader's words out of line with the rest. Now excluded via
  `:not(.reading-font)`.
- **Book mode fully separated (perf):** the heavy overlay moved to `BookReader.tsx`, **lazy-
  loaded** via `next/dynamic` — its pagination code reaches the browser only when a reader
  opens book mode. Book CSS moved out of global `globals.css` into `components/blog/book.css`,
  imported by the toggle, so **listing pages no longer ship any book-mode code or CSS**.

## 2026-07-23 — book mode: paper standard (v1.4.34)

Book mode is now its own printed-page standard, not the sepia theme:
- **Paper palette:** near-black ink on a light warm-white page (was brown-on-tan sepia).
- **Page as a sheet:** the reading area is a paper sheet with inner margins + a soft shadow,
  floating on a slightly deeper surface (the desk / binding) — real open-book depth.
- **Paper grain:** a faint multiplied noise texture over the sheet so the flat screen reads as
  printed stock, not a glowing panel.

## 2026-07-23 — book mode: more Western-book touches (v1.4.33)

- **Small-caps opening line** beside the drop cap (the traditional raised-initial companion).
- **Asterism section breaks:** markdown `---` (`<hr>`) renders as a centred ⁂ instead of a rule.
- **Page number** styled as `— n / total —`.
- **Faint book spine** down the centre gutter between the two columns (sits on the viewport, so
  it holds still while pages flip).

## 2026-07-23 — book mode: sepia, drop cap, #read link (v1.4.32)

- **Always warm-paper (sepia)** regardless of the site theme / dark mode — book mode overrides
  the theme tokens to a paper palette; closing restores the previous colours automatically.
- **`#read` deep link:** book mode is now driven by the URL hash — `…/slug#read` opens it on
  load, the toggle is a real `<a href="#read">` (shareable / copy-link), and Back closes it.
- **Drop cap** on the opening paragraph + oldstyle figures / ligatures where the reading face
  has them — the classic Western chapter opening.
- **Title** smaller (body size) and regular weight, so it recedes further.
- **First-line alignment fixed:** the reader now clones the inner `.prose` (one level, not the
  `#post-body` wrapper), so the first paragraph's top margin actually zeroes and the first
  column opens flush with the second.

## 2026-07-23 — book mode width + title (v1.4.31)

- **Spread now spans the full layout footprint incl. both side gutters** (`viewport − 2×rail
  left`, the centred layout's mirror), not just the narrow content column — wider, less cramped.
  Falls back to near-full width (capped 1400px) when no rail is on screen.
- **Title** in the top bar is no longer bold and uses the faint meta colour, so it recedes and
  the article stays the focus (size unchanged).

## 2026-07-23 — book mode polish (v1.4.30)

Feedback pass on the book reader:
- **Spread width now matches the site's content column** (`#post-body` width) instead of a
  fixed cap, so book mode is exactly as wide as the page reads normally.
- **Book typography reused:** the overlay carries `book-text`, so the same first-line indent +
  justified margins as the normal reading view apply (was plain blocks).
- **Chrome:** dropped the footer; the page count moved up next to the close button (top-right).
- **Title** in the top bar is now centred and larger.
- **First column opens flush** — zeroed the leading top-margin so the first line no longer
  drops down.

## 2026-07-23 — book reading mode (v1.4.29)

- **New "Chế độ đọc sách" reader** (`components/blog/BookMode.tsx`): a toggle on the post meta
  line (after the reading time) opens the article as a **fullscreen two-column book spread**,
  paged horizontally with the arrow keys / on-screen arrows and a soft fade between spreads.
- **Desktop + iPad only** (the toggle is hidden below the iPad width). Uses a fixed overlay, not
  the Fullscreen API, so desktop and iPad behave identically; mobile never shows it.
- **Non-destructive to the base page:** the reader clones the already-rendered `#post-body`
  (Shiki highlight, images, footnotes intact), so normal scroll / SEO / a11y / find-in-page are
  untouched. Content flows via CSS columns; media stays column-width and is capped to a page
  height so nothing overflows a spread. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Admin toggle:** `features.bookMode` (Admin → Settings → Features), **default on**.

## 2026-07-23 — admin Series manager + series-box polish (v1.4.28)

- **New Content → Series tab** (`SeriesManager.tsx`): lists every series (incl. drafts) with
  its ordered parts. Per series you can **rename** it (across all its posts, merges on
  collision), **remove** it (clears `series`+`series_order`; the posts stay), and **reorder**
  parts with up/down arrows. Backed by owner-gated `POST /api/series` (`updateSeries` /
  `reorderSeries`). Series data is derived from the dashboard's existing post index — no extra
  fetch.
- **Series box slimmed:** dropped the prev/next links (redundant with the ordered list); tuned
  the inner padding + part spacing. Removed the now-orphaned `seriesPrev`/`seriesNext` locale
  keys and the `prev`/`next` fields on `SeriesInfo`.
- **JetBrains Mono tracking:** the mono chrome ran airy — gave `jetbrains-mono` the same
  negative letter-spacing treatment Plex Mono already had (`-0.05em`, a touch tighter since
  JetBrains is wider), scoped to chrome text only (the reader's prose is untouched).
- **Refactor:** pure series ordering/grouping (`orderSeries`, `seriesEntries`) moved to a
  client/edge-safe `lib/series-order.ts` so the client `SeriesManager` can import it without
  dragging the db/sharp chain into the browser bundle; `series.ts` re-exports it.

## 2026-07-23 — drop the visible "Updated" line on posts

- Removed the "Updated <date>" text from the post meta line (owner preference — it added
  noise). The JSON-LD `dateModified` (invisible, SEO) is kept. Orphaned `updatedPrefix`
  locale key removed from all 6 dictionaries.

## 2026-07-23 — JetBrains Mono chrome font

- Added **JetBrains Mono** as a second self-hosted monospace option for the system/chrome
  font (Admin → Appearance → System font), alongside IBM Plex Mono. One VARIABLE woff2 per
  subset (wght 100–800; latin + latin-ext + **vietnamese**), so a single face covers every
  weight. Vietnamese coverage verified (U+1EA0–1EF9 + Ă/Đ/Ơ/Ư/₫ present in the subset). Pick
  it from the appearance settings; nothing changes until selected.

## 2026-07-23 — newsletter broadcast + reply notifications (batch 7b)

Completes the newsletter (built on 7a's subscribe/opt-in/SMTP foundation).

- **Broadcast on publish.** When a post first goes live it is emailed ONCE to confirmed
  subscribers (title + excerpt + link + per-recipient unsubscribe). Tracked by a new
  `posts.broadcast_at`; the cron (`broadcastDuePosts`, run on the 5-min publish tick + the
  hourly backstop) finds published, date-reached, not-yet-broadcast posts, sends, and stamps
  them. Scheduled (future-dated) posts broadcast when they actually go live, not when saved.
- **No back-catalogue spam.** The migration backfills every already-live post's `broadcast_at`,
  and `broadcastDuePosts` stamps a due post even when SMTP is off or there are no subscribers —
  so enabling the newsletter later never blasts old posts. Editing a post never re-broadcasts
  (the upsert leaves `broadcast_at` untouched).
- **Comment-reply notifications.** Replying to a comment emails the parent commenter (best-
  effort, transactional; skips self-replies and a deleted parent). Sent via `after()` from the
  comment route (`notifyReply`); no-op without SMTP.
- Pure email builders (`lib/newsletter-email.ts`) — escaped, unit-tested. Migration
  `2026-07-23-broadcast.sql`. i18n ×6. +3 tests.

> **Enabling it:** set SMTP in Admin → Settings → Integrations → Newsletter. Until then the
> sign-up form is hidden and all sends are no-ops (rows/stamps still recorded correctly).

## 2026-07-23 — footnotes + music embeds (batch 6c)

- **Footnotes.** Write `a claim[^1]` + `[^1]: the source` — the reference renders as a
  superscript link and the definitions collect into a list at the foot of the article (with
  back-links). Numbered by first reference. Because the renderer escapes raw HTML (and marked
  has no footnote support), this is done by pre-processing the markdown — references become
  private-use placeholders that survive marked, then become `<sup>` links + the list after
  render (`lib/footnotes.ts`). A `[^x]` inside a fenced code block is left alone; definition
  text is rendered through `renderInlineMarkdown` (escaped). +10 tests.
- **Spotify + Apple Music embeds.** Paste a track/album/playlist (or Apple Music album/
  playlist/song) URL on its own line → a compact audio player, via the SAME plain-`<iframe>`
  path as the video embeds (`videoEmbed`) — no third-party widget script, no CSP change. The
  Apple Music URL is quote-guarded so it can't break out of the iframe `src`.
- **Not doing X / Instagram / gist embeds:** those require third-party widget scripts + CSP
  allowances, and the owner doesn't use them — dropped from the plan (not deferred).

## 2026-07-23 — newsletter: subscribe / opt-in / SMTP (batch 7a)

Own-your-stack newsletter foundation — self-host SMTP, no third-party lock-in.

- **Subscribers + double opt-in.** `subscribers` table (email unique, status
  pending/confirmed/unsubscribed, per-subscriber token). `POST /api/subscribe` creates a
  pending row + emails a confirm link; `GET /api/newsletter/confirm` flips it to confirmed;
  `GET /api/newsletter/unsubscribe` opts out. Confirm/unsubscribe render a standalone result
  page (opened from an email, no app shell). All three are public + rate-limited.
- **SMTP via Nodemailer** (`lib/mail.ts`) — config on `integration_keys` (server-only secrets,
  never in settings.data; env fallback). `sendMail` degrades gracefully when unconfigured (no
  500). Admin: an SMTP config card + subscriber list (counts + delete) in Settings →
  Integrations. New dep: `nodemailer`.
- **Public sign-up form** (`SubscribeForm`) shown at the foot of a post **only when SMTP is
  configured**. i18n ×6 (form + opt-in email + result pages + admin).
- Migration `2026-07-23-newsletter.sql`.

**Deferred to 7b:** broadcasting a post to confirmed subscribers (send-on-publish) and
comment-reply notifications — the send paths that need live SMTP creds to verify end-to-end.

## 2026-07-23 — callouts + copy-code button (batch 6b)

Render-layer editor extras.

- **Callouts:** a blockquote whose first line is `[!NOTE]` (also `TIP` / `WARNING` /
  `IMPORTANT` / `CAUTION`) renders as a labelled callout box. Monochrome by design — an accent
  left-border + a bold label carry the meaning, so it stays on the palette (no semantic
  colours). Post-processed in `PostContent.tsx` (`buildCallouts`); an unknown `[!FOO]` or a
  plain quote is left untouched. +4 tests.
- **Copy-code button:** every code block gets a "Copy" button (the `CodeCopy` client island
  attaches it on mount — the code HTML is server-rendered by Shiki). Revealed on hover, always
  shown on touch. i18n ×6.

**Still deferred (need heavier work, tracked separately):** footnotes — the markdown renderer
escapes raw HTML, so these need a proper `marked` extension, not post-processing; and X /
Instagram / gist embeds — those require third-party widget scripts + CSP allowances.

## 2026-07-23 — per-post SEO, cover image, real dateModified (batch 6a)

Post-metadata half of the editor-completeness batch.

- **Per-post SEO overrides:** `meta_title` / `meta_description` columns. When set they drive the
  `<title>`, meta description, and OpenGraph/Twitter card; blank falls back to the post title +
  excerpt (unchanged behaviour). Editor: an "SEO title / SEO description" section in the post
  settings panel.
- **Cover image:** a `cover_image` — a visible hero shown at the top of the post (and the OG image
  fallback, ahead of the SEO-only featured image). Editor: a Cover image picker.
- **Real `dateModified`:** the Article/BlogPosting JSON-LD now emits the actual last-saved time
  (was a placeholder equal to `datePublished`); the post meta line shows "Updated <date>" when an
  edit lands >24h after publishing. Uses the existing `updated_at`.
- Migration `2026-07-23-post-meta.sql`. i18n ×6 (public "Updated" + admin labels).

**Deferred to batch 6b** (render-layer editor extras): footnotes, callouts/admonitions, code
copy button, and X/Instagram/gist embeds.

## 2026-07-23 — series / collections (batch 5)

Group posts into an ordered **series** (e.g. a multi-part guide).

- **A series is just a name + order on the post** (`series`, `series_order` columns) — no
  separate table. Assign one in the editor (Series field with autocomplete of existing
  names + an Order number). Migration `2026-07-23-series.sql`.
- **Series box** at the top of every post in a series: the ordered list of parts (current
  one highlighted), a "Part n/total" label, and prev/next links within the series
  (`lib/series.ts` → `getSeriesForPost`; public parts only). Ordered by `series_order`, then
  chronologically as a tiebreak.
- **`/series/[slug]` page** lists a series in order (a new public route, ISR-cached; slug
  derived like categories/tags). i18n ×6. +4 tests.

## 2026-07-23 — URL redirects (batch 4)

Move a URL without breaking links. Manage 301/302 redirects in **Settings → SEO**.

- **New `redirects` table** + `lib/redirects.ts` (CRUD) + owner-gated `api/redirects`.
  Migration `2026-07-23-redirects.sql`.
- **Real HTTP redirects from middleware.** `middleware.ts` resolves the request path
  against a redirect map (301 permanent / 302 temporary) BEFORE any render — a page-level
  `redirect()` under a route with a `loading.tsx` is downgraded by Next to a 200
  meta-refresh, so the redirect must come from the edge. The map is fetched from PostgREST
  with a plain (edge-safe) fetch and cached in-process for 60s; the matcher now runs on all
  paths except `/_next` and `/uploads`. Fail-open — a lookup error never blocks a request.
- **Auto-301 on slug rename.** Renaming a post/page slug adds a permanent redirect from the
  old path (existing links + search results keep working); saving a slug also clears any
  stale redirect that used it as a source, so live content always wins and a rename-back
  can't self-loop.
- Admin: a **Redirects** card (list + add + delete) in Settings → SEO. i18n ×6. +8 tests.

## 2026-07-23 — scheduled publishing (batch 3)

Publish a post with a **future date** and it goes live on time, automatically.

- **No new status.** A `published` post dated in the future is simply hidden by the existing
  read layer (`isPublicallyVisible` — lists, search, and the `/[slug]` page), so scheduling is a
  property of the date, not a state machine. New `isScheduled` helper = its exact complement.
- **Editor cue.** With a future date the Publish button reads **Schedule**, the toast says
  **Scheduled**, a "Scheduled for <local time>" note appears under the date, and the live
  "View post" link is hidden (the URL 404s until it goes live); "Preview draft" still works.
- **On time, not within the hour.** `lib/scheduled.ts` `sweepScheduled` (run by the cron) finds
  posts that crossed their time within a bounded lookback (`newlyLive`, a pure `(since, now]`
  window) and runs one `purgeAndWarm` so the edge 404 is flushed and the origin re-warmed. A new
  **5-min publish tick** (`/api/cron?publish=1`) does only this; the hourly maintenance tick sweeps
  a ~65-min window as a backstop. No watermark stored (an overlapping purge is an idempotent
  superset). `docker-compose.yml` + `docs/self-host-native.md` updated with the new cadence.

## 2026-07-23 — accessibility pass (batch 2)

Audit-driven a11y + polish across the reader and admin (no feature change):

- **Contrast:** secondary text (`--c-meta`) darkened to meet WCAG AA in light mode
  (dates, captions, excerpts, ToC, pagination); admin helper text likewise.
- **Keyboard focus:** one visible `:focus-visible` ring site-wide; comment fields no
  longer strip their outline.
- **Skip link:** a localized "skip to content" jump (all 6 languages) + `<main id>` so
  keyboard/screen-reader users bypass the header controls.
- **Headings:** a body `#` is demoted to `<h2>` so the post title stays the only `<h1>`
  (fixes the outline / duplicate-h1).
- **Comment form:** every field now has an accessible label (`aria-label`).
- **Lightbox:** its round controls render round again (they were squared by the global
  sharp-corner reset); pagination tap targets meet the 44px minimum.
- **Print:** a clean print/PDF stylesheet (drops chrome, black-on-white type).
- **i18n:** the last hardcoded Vietnamese strings in the editor chrome moved to locales.

## 2026-07-23 — pre-SaaS hardening (batch 1): safer restore + robustness

Foundational fixes from the pre-SaaS audit (no user-facing behaviour change):

- **Backup restore is now transactional.** The content tables are cleared + re-inserted
  inside one `restore_tables` DB transaction, so a mid-restore failure rolls the whole DB
  back instead of leaving the site half-restored. Identity ids are preserved, so threaded
  `comments.parent_id` links survive a restore (the old per-table path re-keyed and could
  break them). Requires migration `2026-07-23-restore-rpc.sql`.
- **Rate limiter no longer leaks memory** (evicts aged-out IP keys) and **prefers
  `CF-Connecting-IP`** over the client-forwardable `X-Forwarded-For`, so a spoofed header
  can't evade limits or poison the analytics visitor hash / country.
- **CSP hardening:** added the safe, no-nonce subset (`object-src 'none'`, `base-uri`,
  `form-action`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`); a full script-src+nonce policy is a follow-up.
- **Analytics inserts no longer swallow real errors** — the base-row fallback fires only on
  a genuine missing-column (42703, pre-migration); other errors are logged, not hidden.
- **Font src URLs are validated** before landing in `@font-face { src: url(...) }` (rejects
  `javascript:`/`data:` and `url()`-breaking characters).

## 2026-07-23 — admin Library + Settings declutter

- **Library (Images) is calmer and more usable.** New toolbar: total **count + size**, a **name
  search**, and a **sort** (newest / name / size). Each tile keeps the info you wanted — `dims · size
  · date` on one tidy row with a compact date — and the per-tile copy / download / delete actions now
  **overlay the thumbnail** (revealed on hover, always shown on touch) so they cost **zero layout
  height** and the grid reads clean. The grid is 5-across at desktop (was 6) so the caption fits
  without truncating. The three Library tabs use the shared kit `Tabs` (was a one-off inline copy).
- **Settings reorganized for clearer grouping.** WordPress **import moved out of Integrations** into
  **Content** (a one-time content tool, not an integration), so Integrations is now purely external
  services (Backup, MCP, Cloudflare). **Appearance** is two balanced columns — palette + custom CSS on
  the left, the type stack (font / typography / rendering) on the right — and **SEO** is full-width.
  Nothing stretches a narrow form across a lone full-width row.
- No behaviour or data changes — pure admin layout/UX; all settings and library actions work exactly
  as before.

## 2026-07-22 — analytics v2: engagement, audience, sources, per-page drill-down

- **Much deeper Analytics.** The overview now shows five headline metrics — views, visitors
  (trend + new-vs-returning), **avg time on page** (dwell), avg read depth, and a **bounce rate**
  (single-page-visit share) — a **dual-series time chart** (views + visitors, pure SVG; the year
  range buckets by month, 24h by hour), a **top pages** table where each row links to its own
  drill-down, **traffic channels** (Direct/Search/Social/Referral) beside top referrers, an
  **audience** breakdown (countries + **device / browser / OS**), and the **read-depth
  distribution**. All source/audience lists count **distinct visitors**, not page views.
- **Per-page drill-down** (`/admin/analytics?path=/slug`): one URL's trend, referrers, countries and
  read-depth over the same ranges.
- **Accuracy.** Time buckets are truncated in `ANALYTICS_TZ` (IANA zone, e.g. `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`;
  defaults to UTC) so "days" match local midnight instead of UTC — fixes the shifted-day drift. The
  bot filter also drops the common AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, CCBot, PerplexityBot, Bytespider…).
- **Privacy unchanged.** Audience columns are **coarse UA buckets** (device/browser/os) parsed at
  insert (`lib/ua.ts`) — the raw user-agent is never stored, so still no fingerprint / no cookies.
  Dwell time is sampled alongside scroll depth on page leave.
- **Migration:** run `scripts/migrations/2026-07-22-analytics-v2.sql` on the live DB (adds the
  audience/dwell columns + the tz-aware `analytics_summary` / new `analytics_page` RPCs). The UI
  falls back to the base shape and hides the new sections until it is applied.

## 2026-07-20 — grid-view toggle (admin); timeline polish

- **Grid view is now an owner feature toggle** (`features.gridView`, Admin → Settings → Tính năng, default
  on). Off hides the header grid/list button and the no-FOUC script ignores a stored `list=grid`, so every
  listing stays a list — handy because the infinite-scroll timeline is hidden in grid view.
- **Timeline redesign**: the feed is grouped by year and the **year is now a sticky header** (`fs-h3`) that
  pins to the top of the gutter while its months scroll, then gets pushed out when the next year arrives (its
  `--c-bg` tag masks months sliding under it). Months keep their round `--c-meta` dots; the spine is the faint
  `--c-rule` hairline of the sidebar dividers; dots are round (explicit exception to the square-corners rule).
  It also appears at a much lower viewport width (a short date label needs only a thin gutter), so it shows on
  normal laptops instead of only very wide screens.

## 2026-07-20 — infinite scroll + date timeline; condensed category cloud

- **Infinite scroll** (`features.infiniteScroll`, off by default; Admin → Settings → Tính năng):
  home / category / tag listings reveal posts on scroll instead of paginating. The full published
  list is handed to the new `InfiniteListing` client island as light metadata (no post bodies), so
  revealing more is pure client work — no network; the first `postsPerPage` chunk still server-renders
  for SEO, and `/page/[n]` URLs 404 (duplicate content).
- **Date timeline** in the right gutter when infinite scroll is on: a spine down the feed with a marker at
  each month/year boundary (bold year + accent dot, quiet month name) placed level with that period's first
  post, so the dates line up with the posts on the left and scroll with the page (pure CSS — no measurement,
  no counts, no click nav). Desktop list view only — hidden on mobile and in grid view. The left rail is
  forced to its single-rail (all-blocks-stacked) branch.
- **Categories in the sidebar** now render as a condensed wrapped cloud (`CategoryCloud`) with the post
  count in parentheses, instead of a tall one-per-line list — much less vertical space.

## 2026-07-19 — listing grid: 2 columns at reading-column width

- **Grid mode (home / category / tag listings) now stays 2 columns and keeps the
  reading-column width**, matching the list view. Dropped the desktop-only override
  that widened the grid into the free right gutter and laid it out in 3 columns
  (`listingGridCss` removed; the base `globals.css` 1/2-column grid is all that's needed).

## 2026-07-16 — video upload: Library Videos tab + native player

- **Library → Videos tab** (between Images and Files): upload videos (drag-drop,
  `video/*`), preview in a grid of native players, copy URL, multi-select delete.
  Videos are attachments in the shared files store — no schema change.
- **Self-hosted video in posts**: paste the video URL on its own line (like a
  YouTube link) → the published page renders a native `<video>` player. Content
  stays 100% Markdown.
- **`/uploads` now streams with byte-range support** (206) — video seeking and iOS
  Safari playback work; large files no longer buffer whole in server memory (images
  benefit too). Video/audio MIME types added so browsers play instead of download.

## 2026-07-15 — leaner reader payload, one font law, agent-ready

Performance:
- **Split the stylesheet** into a public and an admin entry (Tailwind scoped per surface),
  so a reader never downloads admin CSS — public CSS dropped ~13 KB → ~9 KB gzip.
- **Lazy-load the comment island** (with its `next-auth` dependency) below the fold via
  `IntersectionObserver` — it's out of the initial reader payload until scrolled near.
- **Font loading is now one system-wide law** (`docs/performance.md`): preload only the
  reading font (the LCP title) subsets the site language needs — latin, plus vietnamese
  on a vi site, nothing for CJK or an uploaded custom font — and never the chrome font.
  Cuts the font contention on the LCP critical path for every language/preset/upload.

Agent-ready (AI agents can find, read, and drive the site):
- **Markdown for Agents**: request any post/page with `Accept: text/markdown` to get its
  authored Markdown instead of HTML.
- **Discovery**: MCP Server Card (`/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`), API Catalog
  (`/.well-known/api-catalog`, RFC 9727), `/auth.md`, and homepage `Link:` headers.
- **`Content-Signal`** in `robots.txt` declaring content-usage preferences.
- Fixed a reverse-proxy rule that was returning 404 for the OAuth/MCP discovery routes.

## 2026-07-14 — sidebar refinements

- Sidebar order is now **menu → most viewed → featured → categories → tags** (categories sit directly
  above tags).
- **Most viewed** defaults to **3** posts and is configurable in **Settings → Site → Layout & menu**
  (0 hides the block).
- The **Featured** picker moved to **Settings → Site → Layout & menu**, right under the site menu.
- Post/page **reading views no longer show the menu/blocks** in the rail — only the table of contents.
  The main (listing) sidebar keeps the full menu + blocks.
- **Footer links open in a new tab** by default (external links only).

## 2026-07-14 — site menu moves into the sidebar; wider rail

- The **site menu** now lives at the top of the sidebar (above Categories) instead of a header
  dropdown. On desktop it sits in the always-visible left rail; the header menu button is gone.
- On mobile the header keeps a menu button, but it now opens the **sidebar drawer** (menu + the rest)
  rather than a separate dropdown — one drawer for everything. The old edge-handle tab is retired.
- The desktop rail is **wider** (210 → 250px) so longer titles wrap less; the gap tightens slightly so
  laptops keep the gutter rail. The mobile drawer is unchanged.

## 2026-07-14 — sidebar: most-viewed & featured posts

- The listing sidebar now shows two new blocks between **Categories** and **Tags**: **Most viewed**
  (automatic — top 5 posts by all-time views) and **Featured** (owner-curated). Each hides itself
  when empty.
- **Featured** is picked in **Admin → Settings → Content**: an ordered list of published posts
  (add / reorder / remove); the first 5 render, in that order, and any post that stops being public
  drops out automatically.
- The view-totals read now uses a cache-eligible GET rpc, so listing pages stay statically ISR-rendered.

## 2026-07-14 — fix intermittent image-upload / save-draft failures

- Fixed a native-only bug where generating an image's responsive variants/thumbnails read the
  original back over HTTP from its store URL. On the local-filesystem store that URL is a
  relative `/uploads/...` path with no origin, so the server-side fetch threw "Failed to parse
  URL" — surfacing as an occasional upload error, a failed **Save draft** (the save also
  finalizes the images it embeds), and hourly cron errors. Variants/thumbs now read the bytes
  straight from the store; a missing original is skipped instead of throwing.

## 2026-07-14 — IBM Plex Mono chrome tracking

- Tightened the interface tracking by `-0.04em` **only** when the system font is IBM Plex Mono, so the
  wide monospace no longer reads as spaced-out in the rail, menu, footer, and dates. Scoped to the
  chrome via `<html data-chrome-font>`; article text and the other system-font choices are unchanged.

## 2026-07-14 — system-chrome font selector

- Added a **System font** selector (Admin → Appearance) that sets the interface face — header,
  footer, menu, dates, admin — independently of the reading font, so the chrome can use a code
  font while article text stays readable. Options: Inter (default), the reading font, or the new
  self-hosted **IBM Plex Mono** (latin / latin-ext / Vietnamese, preloaded only when active).
- Replaced the old "keep the interface in Inter" toggle; existing sites that had it off now follow
  the reading font automatically, with no visible change.

## 2026-07-13 — editor focus and typewriter feedback

- Removed the global admin focus rectangle from the TipTap writing surface; keyboard focus remains
  visible on actual controls, while the editor continues to sit inside its bordered card.
- Added a visible block-style typewriter caret plus distinct insert/delete strikes on the active line.
  The caret is an overlay, so it never enters the ProseMirror document or changes selection; its blink
  and strikes respect both the site motion switch and reduced-motion preferences.
- Added generated mechanical key clicks, ultimately raised from 20% to 45% internal volume after production review: insertion is short and crisp, deletion
  is slightly lower. Audio is created locally with Web Audio, has no asset/network request, and only
  runs from direct editor input (composition updates are excluded).
- Added an Appearance → Rendering switch for all typewriter feedback. It persists in the existing
  motion settings and disables the custom caret, line response, and sound together.

## 2026-07-13 — admin form and toolbar visual correction

- Centered the editor formatting row whenever it fits, while retaining one-line horizontal scrolling
  on narrow screens.
- Reworked palette selection so inactive and hidden themes remain legible; selection, visibility, and
  default state now use neutral borders and surfaces instead of fading the complete control.
- Standardized backup scheduling and WordPress import around the shared rounded inputs and buttons.
  The native file-picker chrome is hidden behind an accessible, labeled control; all behavior is unchanged.
- Confirmed the light admin canvas remains a true neutral gray (`#f5f5f5`) with no blue tint.

## 2026-07-13 — editor toolbar and admin footer correction

- **Editor toolbar:** converted descriptive actions to compact line icons while preserving B/I/U/S,
  P, and H1–H5 as familiar text marks. The toolbar is permanently one row, horizontally scrollable
  at every breakpoint, and table actions join the same row contextually. Removing `overflow-hidden`
  from the editor frame restores reliable sticky behavior while scrolling.
- **Editor spacing/title:** reduced the gap below the action header and above the writing frame;
  post titles now auto-grow to their complete wrapped height instead of being clipped to two rows.
- **Sidebar footer:** light/dark now carries its sun/moon icon and shares the exact row geometry of
  Clear cache and Sign out. Admin canvas changed from cool gray to a true neutral `#f5f5f5`.

## 2026-07-13 — modern admin design system

- **Admin-only rounded component system:** the global square-corner rule now excludes `.admin-shell`.
  Public reading pages remain untouched; admin cards/tables use 16px, grouped controls 12px, and
  buttons/inputs/navigation 8px. Focus rings, borders, shadows, heights, and hover states are shared.
- **Layout and navigation:** rebalanced the admin workspace around a 208px desktop sidebar (72px
  collapsed), 1480px content ceiling, responsive gutters, clearer active rows, and a floating mobile
  drawer. The cool-gray monochrome palette remains; no public palette color enters admin.
- **All main surfaces:** modernized Overview, Analytics, Content, Comments, Media, Trash, Settings,
  Log, Help, the post editor, and the page editor. Stats are separate cards, tabs are segmented,
  tables have rounded frames and hover rows, settings keep two columns, and editor header/writing/
  property surfaces now align visually.
- **Behavior preserved:** no route, API, schema, query, form state, autosave, revision, preview,
  upload, cache, backup, publishing, or deletion logic changed in this redesign.

## 2026-07-12 — UI follow-up and owner-approved baselines

- **Public header icons:** restored the established search, three-circle palette, applied-theme
  sun/moon, and asymmetric two-line menu glyphs after a replacement set failed visual review.
  `ICON_BTN` remains the single source for their button size, alignment, and interaction chrome.
- **Mobile reading rail:** reduced the edge handle from 24 × 76px to 16 × 64px and its chevron to
  10 × 18px, with quieter neutral fill and opacity. The drawer behavior and reading-column layout
  are unchanged.
- **Documentation baseline:** recorded that public typography is intentionally unchanged, desktop
  Settings remains two-column, H1–H5 remain directly available in the editor, the editor header is
  framed and aligned to the writing surface, and Clear cache remains in the admin sidebar footer.

## v1.4.5 — 2026-07-11 (docs refresh)

Documentation only — no code change. Brings the project "About" (README's *What it is*) and the internal
docs current with the v1.4.4 line. README now lists the editorial admin, drag-drop / paste uploads (incl.
AVIF), the captioned-figure sizes (column / large / full-bleed / gallery), full-bleed mobile images, and
the in-app Help / Guide. `docs/features.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/conventions.md` and `CHECKLIST.md`
are re-synced to the redesigned admin (flat canvas, slimmed Overview, light/dark + Sign-out footer, the
post editor's sticky header) and the full 15-table schema list.

## v1.4.4 — 2026-07-11 (stable: reading layout, admin redesign, media hardening)

Consolidates the whole 1.4.1–1.4.4 line into one stable entry: the sidebar rail + accent colour and
layout toggles, built-in reading fonts + book-page text, the nested/scrolling table of contents, SEO
(canonical + breadcrumbs), cache-clear-on-deploy, a fuller admin dashboard + Help page, an editorial
redesign of the admin workspace, full-bleed mobile images, and a hardened image upload/delete path.
Nothing here changes an existing install's hue or breaks its settings.

**Admin — an editorial redesign of the workspace.** The admin adopts a calmer, monochrome design system:
the editor chrome and the settings grid are realigned, the action header is framed, and long editor titles
wrap instead of overflowing. Structure and behaviour are unchanged — it just reads cleaner.

**Reading — large images go full-bleed on phones.** On a phone every in-body image now spans edge to edge
of the screen (gallery grids excepted) for an editorial look — no horizontal scroll. On wide screens the
"large" size (renamed from "Wide +30%") noses right into the free gutter by one rail width instead of
overflowing both sides / colliding with the ToC rail; on tablets and narrow desktop it sits at the column
width.

**Editor — the draft preview opens in a new tab and is always current.** The "Preview draft" button (was a
copy-link) saves any pending edits first, then opens `/preview/{slug}` in a new tab; the preview page reads
live (`fetchCache='force-no-store'`) so it never shows a stale revision after a save.

**Media — upload & delete hardened.** The original is written with an exclusive (O_EXCL) file write, so two
concurrent uploads that pick the same name retry a fresh name instead of overwriting each other and 500-ing
on the `path` primary key. Dimensions + the thumbnail are best-effort — a valid image never fails the upload
because thumbnailing hiccuped. AVIF is accepted; unsupported types show a clear message. Purging a trashed
image still referenced by a post/page/revision/setting now asks for confirmation before it can break a live
page.

**Admin — a Help / Guide page.** A new sidebar item (`/admin/help`) with a concise, sectioned index:
writing &amp; publishing, the five settings tabs, server &amp; self-host, Cloudflare (Cache Rules, Tiered
Cache, SSL, auto-purge), cache &amp; operations, and MCP — each linking out to the repo docs for depth.
Content is English (canonical, like the docs); the nav label + title are localized in all six languages.
Pure server component, ships no client JS.

**Cache — "Clear all cache" (and the deploy flush) now re-prime in the right order.** The warm step used
to run BEFORE the Cloudflare purge (which fired post-response), so it re-cached stale bytes the purge then
wiped — leaving the cache cold. `purgeAndWarm()` now purges the origin ISR + the whole CF zone FIRST, then
re-warms the origin render cache (home + newest pages, over loopback so it's reliable). This primes the
**origin** render cache — a reader's first post-purge miss renders fast instead of cold. (Pre-filling the
CF edge for a distant reader's region isn't possible from the origin — CF cache is per-datacentre; enable
**CF Tiered Cache** so a POP miss pulls from a warm tier instead of the far origin.)

**Fix — no more "stuck on the loading skeleton after a deploy."** A frequent deploy left already-open
tabs on the old build; a soft navigation then mixed an old client runtime with new-build RSC/chunks and
the router hung on the skeleton until a manual reload. `next.config` now sets a per-deploy `deploymentId`
(read from a `.deployment-id` file the deploy writes before build), so Next tags every asset/RSC request
with `?dpl=<id>` and the client hard-reloads the instant it sees a different id from the server — it
self-heals instead of getting stuck.

**OG card — post share previews show title + excerpt + date.** The generated Open Graph / Twitter card
for a post replaces the bottom "site name" line with a fuller excerpt (up to 320 chars, 4-line-clamped) and its publish
date, so a shared link reads like the homepage entry. Home/category/tag cards are unchanged. `/og` gains
`desc` + `date` query params.

**Reading — nested table of contents.** When a post mixes heading levels (H2 + H3), the top-level (H2)
rows get a bigger dot marker and the child (H3) rows go smaller with no dot — a few big markers over
quieter children. A post that is all-H2 or all-H3 stays uniform, as before. A long ToC that outruns the
viewport now scrolls inside its own (sticky) box instead of pinning its tail off-screen, and the gutter
rail is 30px wider (210px) to wrap less — the breakpoint is unchanged, so 1280/1366 laptops still show it.

**Admin — a fuller Overview.** The dashboard gains an **SEO health** card (published count + how many
posts miss an excerpt or a cover image, each linking to Content), a **Traffic sources** card (top
referrers + countries over 30 days by distinct visitor), a **Clear cache** button and a **View site**
link in Quick actions, and the System panel's Backups row now shows the **last run** (or "never").

**SEO — canonical + breadcrumbs.** Every indexable page now emits a self-referencing
`<link rel="canonical">` (home, posts, pages, category/tag, and each `…/page/[n]`), and posts carry a
`BreadcrumbList` (Home → category → post) alongside the existing `BlogPosting`. `/page/1` (and
`/category|tag/<x>/page/1`) now 308-redirect to the base instead of serving a duplicate of page 1.
(Unknown URLs already return a `noindex` soft-404 — Next's documented streaming behaviour — so they
were never indexable; no change there.)

**Cache — deploy flush.** `GET /api/cron?purge=1` (same `CRON_SECRET` auth) forces a full
`revalidateEverything()` — Next paths + the whole Cloudflare zone — so a code deploy, which runs no
admin write, still clears the edge. Content saves and the "Clear all cache" button already purge the
zone when the CF token+zone are set.

**New — built-in fonts** (Admin → Appearance → Font). Four self-hosted families: Inter, Source
Sans 3, Literata, Source Serif 4. Each is subset per unicode-range, so a family downloads only when
chosen. Picking a font also loads its tuned text sizing (a serif runs small, wants a tighter
leading) into the editable roles, which the owner still owns. An uploaded custom font overrides the
chosen built-in. (Bookerly was requested but is Amazon-proprietary; Source Serif 4 stands in.)

The chosen font styles the reader's words — post body + title, list cards, comment body, and the
editor. System chrome (dates, reading-time, related posts, header, footer, sidebar, admin) stays
Inter by default; a `fontChromeInter` toggle (Admin → Appearance) extends the chosen font across the
whole interface when turned off.

**New — book-page reading** (Admin → Settings → Features, `bookText`). Optional typesetting for the
post body: a first-line indent on each paragraph and justified text on columns 600px and wider, for a
printed-page feel.

**Sidebar — reaches every listing and marks where you are.** It now shows on home pages 2+ and on
category and tag archives (not just home page 1); the category or tag you are viewing carries the
accent mark, like a post's table of contents. Its breakpoint dropped so common 1280/1366 laptops show
the rail in the gutter instead of only the drawer handle.

**Fix — editor shows every category and tag.** The category/tag picker capped its suggestions at 12,
so terms past the first dozen never appeared to click. It now offers them all (scrollable), and typing
filters the list by substring.

**MCP — `patch_post`.** A new tool that partially updates one post by slug: only the fields you pass
change, the body and everything else stay put. Lets an agent tweak just the title, tags, or category
without resending the whole post (`update_post` still does a full replace).

**Fix — no more empty-slug posts.** A title/slug made only of emoji or punctuation slugified to `''`,
and the empty-slug row was unreachable from the editor and Trash (couldn't be edited or deleted).
`savePost`/`savePage` now fall back to a timestamped slug, so every post/page keeps an editable identity.

**Fix — serif reading fonts sit lighter.** Literata and Source Serif 4 rendered a large body (19px) and
a very black 700 bold that out-weighed the 600 headings, so bold read like a second heading. Body drops
to 18px (Literata) / 18.4px (Source Serif); presets now carry `readingBold: 600` (`--reading-bold`) so
`.prose` bold stays emphasis beneath the headings. Sans faces are unchanged.

**New — the sidebar rail.** Categories + tags (home) and a post's table of contents now live in the
left gutter, sticky, ranged right against a hairline divider, their first line level with the
content's first line. The reading column stays exactly centred: the rail is absolutely placed and
never displaces it. Its breakpoint is computed from `contentWidth`, so a wider column keeps the rail
hidden for longer. Below that width the SAME markup becomes a slide-out drawer behind a small edge
handle (`RailHandle` toggles `<html data-rail>`; drawer, handle and scrim all react in CSS).

**New — `accent`, a 7th palette colour** (Admin → Appearance). One highlight, used identically
everywhere: the marker beside the rail row you are reading, and the underline under any link you
hover (`.link-accent`, plus `.prose a:hover`). Seeded from each palette's `link`, so Mono stays
monochrome and no existing site changes hue. Settings saved before this key migrate on read.

**New feature toggles** (Admin → Settings → Features), all default on: `sidebar`, `leadPost` (the
newest post on home page 1 takes the h1 role), `categoryLabel`, `deck` (the excerpt as a standfirst
under a post title). Title display sizes come from the h1/h2 type roles, never a hardcoded value.

**Fixed**
- The table of contents never marked the section you were reading. An `IntersectionObserver` over
  the headings goes blank mid-section — the heading has already scrolled past, so nothing intersects.
  It now tracks the last heading past the reading line, coalesced to one measurement per frame.
- The drawer handle jumped half its height down the screen on every tap: it centred itself with
  `transform: translateY(-50%)`, which the global press feedback (`button:active{transform:scale(.97)}`)
  overwrote. It centres with `translate` now.
- The rail rendered before the page heading, so every page's outline opened with the sidebar's `h2`
  ahead of the article's `h1`.

**Changed**
- The table of contents is no longer a bordered, shadowed panel pinned to the viewport edge; it is
  type in the rail. It now opens with the post title (click = back to top) and closes with the
  tags/categories/comments jump, so a post with no headings still gets a usable index.
- The global `<hr>` runs the full column width instead of a left-aligned 50% stub.
- No rule between list cards and none under a post title: whitespace separates them. The
  end-of-article rules (before tags / related / comments) stay.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-07-09 (WordPress import, ops hardening, deep-audit fixes)

Outcome of a full read-through audit (UI/UX, typography, logic/cache, security, self-host
readiness). No CRITICAL/HIGH security holes were found; the rest is new capability + fixes.

**New — WordPress import (Admin → Settings → Integrations)**
- Upload a WordPress export (`Tools → Export → All content`, a WXR `.xml`) and its posts + pages
  import as Markdown — no CLI, no credentials. HTML → Markdown (turndown + GFM), categories/tags/
  dates/status/excerpt preserved, figure captions folded into the image alt, `Uncategorized` dropped.
  New content is ADDED (slug collisions get a numeric suffix; nothing is overwritten); images keep
  their source URLs. `lib/wordpress-import.ts` (pure, tested) + `POST /api/import/wordpress` +
  `ImportFields`. Replaces the removed, broken legacy CLI script.

**Ops / self-host readiness**
- **`GET /api/health`** — liveness/readiness probe (Postgres reachable + local store writable, 200/503);
  wired as the Docker `app` healthcheck.
- **Boot-time env validation** — `src/instrumentation.ts` + `src/env.ts` fail fast with a readable list
  when a required var is missing (guarded off build + edge, so `next build` still needs no backend env).
- **DB migration runner** — `schema_migrations` ledger + `scripts/migrate.sh` (`npm run migrate`) apply
  pending `scripts/migrations/*.sql` idempotently on upgrade; a Docker one-shot `migrate` service runs
  it before the app. Fresh installs seed the ledger from `schema.sql`.
- **Community + CI** — `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR templates, and a CI workflow
  (`check:all` + `build`).

**Security hardening**
- Generous per-IP rate limits on the public endpoints (`lib/rate-limit.ts`): `/api/track` (240/min,
  silent drop), `/api/search` (60/min → 429), `/api/mcp/register` (5/min).
- `/api/mcp/register` now gated behind `mcpEnabled()` (503 when off) so a disabled server can't grow
  the `mcp_clients` table.
- `/api/cron` uses a constant-time bearer compare; its maintenance steps are isolated so a finalize
  failure no longer skips the backup, and backup failures are logged.
- Backup **restore aborts** if the pre-restore safety snapshot fails, instead of overwriting with no
  recovery point.

**Fixes**
- Sitemap no longer lists category/tag URLs that 404 (derived from public posts only).
- Admin palette label `scifi` was keyed on a stale `rose` in all 6 locales → every language fell back
  to English; fixed.
- Admin Media/File library dates were hardcoded Vietnamese in every language → now locale-aware.
- A just-saved post now re-purges once its deferred AVIF/WebP variants finish, so `<picture>` appears
  without waiting on the ~1h ISR window.

**UI / typography**
- **Sharp corners everywhere** — one global `border-radius: 0` reset (house style).
- Removed `tracking-tight` from public headings so the Admin letter-spacing control actually applies.
- Visible focus ring on the two public search inputs.

**Cleanup**
- Removed dead code (`blobOrigin` + its layout block, `deleteByUrl`, `countByPost`, `tokenLimit`, an
  unused `signIn`); deduped `escapeHtml`; excerpt now clamps by chars too.

> Note: the CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) must be added by a push with the GitHub
> `workflow` OAuth scope — it ships in the repo tree but a scopeless token can't create it.

## v1.3.6 — 2026-07-04 (fix: Cloudflare integration card reflects the saved state at once)

- The Cloudflare cache card now `router.refresh()`es after a successful save, so the "· saved"
  placeholder hint updates immediately instead of only after a manual page reload.
- Operational note (self-host): after an `ALTER TABLE` on a live database, reload the PostgREST
  schema cache (restart the service or `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`) — otherwise PostgREST keeps
  its old schema and silently ignores writes to the new columns.

## v1.3.5 — 2026-07-04 (Auto CDN purge: Cloudflare cache clears on every write)

- **Cloudflare cache auto-purge.** Enter a Cloudflare API token (Zone.Cache Purge permission) + Zone
  ID in Admin → Settings → Integrations; the app then purges the whole zone on every content change
  and on "Clear all cache", so an edit is live instantly with no manual purge. Best-effort and
  non-blocking (fires after the response via `after()`), a no-op when unconfigured. Credentials are
  server-only (the `integration_keys` table, env fallback `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`),
  never sent to the client. New `lib/cdn.ts`, hooked into `lib/revalidate.ts` (the single write choke
  point `freshenData`), new `CloudflareFields` admin card + `POST /api/integrations/cloudflare`.
- DB: adds `cloudflare_api_token` + `cloudflare_zone_id` to `integration_keys` (idempotent upgrade in
  `scripts/schema.sql`).

## v1.3.0 — 2026-07-04 (Native self-host: drop Vercel + Supabase-cloud, local-filesystem storage)

Quire is now self-hosted only, in two deploy flavors: **native** (install PostgreSQL + PostgREST +
the app directly on a Linux server) and **Docker** (unchanged). Vercel hosting and Supabase-cloud are
no longer supported targets.

**Storage: local filesystem only**
- Removed the Vercel Blob storage driver and the `@vercel/blob` dependency; binaries always live on
  the local filesystem (`STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR`, served at `/uploads`). `blob.ts` is now a thin facade over
  `blob-local.ts` (lazy-loaded so `node:fs` stays off the client). Deleted the browser-direct-upload
  token routes (`/api/{media,files}/blob-token`) and the `STORAGE_DRIVER` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_DRIVER`
  switches — uploads always POST to the server (no 4.5MB cap).
- Image refs stay store-relative: `collapseBlob` strips the `/uploads` prefix, `expandBlob` re-adds it.

**Deploy**
- New native install guide (`docs/self-host-native.md`) + systemd / PostgREST config templates in
  `deploy/native/`. Removed `vercel.json`.
- `.env.example` is now the native template. `SUPABASE_URL` points at your own PostgREST endpoint with
  `POSTGREST_DIRECT=1`; the `supabase-js` client and `SUPABASE_*` env names stay because they speak the
  PostgREST protocol, not a Supabase cloud project.
- Admin System panel reports self-host facts (Self-hosted / PostgreSQL / Local filesystem); dropped the
  Vercel region/branch/commit rows and the Supabase/Blob dashboard links.
- Analytics + comments read the visitor country from the CDN/proxy edge header (`cf-ipcountry`).

**Migration**
- `scripts/legacy/blob-to-local.mjs` mirrors a legacy Vercel Blob store to the local filesystem
  (pathnames preserved, so store-relative content renders unchanged).
- Docs refreshed to the native-first model (README, ARCHITECTURE, CLAUDE, ROADMAP, CHECKLIST, docs/*).

## v1.2.6 — 2026-06-26 (Quire 1.2: rebrand, dashboard, deeper analytics, galleries, lightbox & reworked editor)
Consolidates the whole 1.2.0–1.2.6 line into one entry.

**Rebrand**
- Renamed the project to **Quire** (a.k.a. Quire Blog): brand, wordmark (`quire`**blog**), package
  name, Docker/Postgres/MCP identifiers, GitHub URLs and the Drive backup folder (`quire-backups`);
  the `vibeblog-private` creds repo keeps its name.

**Admin dashboard & analytics**
- **Overview is now a dashboard:** a Traffic card (30-day views + visitors with a sparkline +
  last-7-days), Most-viewed posts, and a Needs-attention card (draft count).
- **Deeper analytics:** period-over-period trend (▲/▼) on views + visitors, a new-vs-returning split,
  top pages as a labelled Page/Views/Visitors/Depth table, and top referrers + countries counted by
  **distinct visitor** (one person = 1, not page views; country shows a flag) + a CSV export of the
  daily series. Needs a one-time DB migration (`scripts/migrations/2026-06-25-analytics-deepening.sql`
  then `…-analytics-fix-visitor-counts.sql`); until applied those sections fall back / stay hidden.
- **Faster admin home:** dropped a per-post content scan (`findUnusedMedia`, hundreds of serial
  queries) from the dashboard — it stays an on-demand check on the Media page.

**Image galleries & lightbox**
- Mark images `#grid` (a toolbar **Gallery** button with a multi-select picker, or the per-image
  **Grid** toggle); consecutive ones render as a **smart CSS grid** whose column count adapts to the
  image count (2→2, 3→3, 4→2×2, 5–9→3, 10+→4; collapses to 2 on phones).
- Picking several gallery images inserts **all** of them in one transaction (was keeping only the
  last — each `setImage` replaced the prior selected node).
- The editor preview lays gallery images **side-by-side** like the published grid (via
  `.react-renderer:has(> figure.img-grid)`), distinct from full-width single images.
- **Lightbox:** clicking any post/page image opens a full-size overlay with prev/next, keyboard nav
  (←/→/Esc), a counter and the caption.

**Editor**
- **Offline local autosave** (`useLocalDraft.ts`): unsaved edits are stashed in `localStorage` every
  8s and never hit the server until Save/Publish — editing a *published* post can no longer push
  half-finished text live, and a dropped connection won't lose work. A "restore / discard" bar offers
  any recovered draft on return; `beforeunload` still warns.
- **Editable tables:** a contextual control row (add/remove column, add/remove row, delete table)
  appears when the cursor is inside a table; the header row + left column are shaded with the table's
  own `--c-rule` colour as a visual spine (left-column shade is CSS-only, never changes the Markdown).
- **Live toolbar + floating selection menu:** the editor sets `shouldRerenderOnTransaction` so the
  toolbar reacts to the cursor (active highlights, the table row); selecting text — or putting the
  cursor in a link — pops a compact bubble (bold / italic / underline / strike / code + link
  edit/remove) that follows light/dark mode. Menu UI lives in `EditorMenus.tsx`.
- Drag-dropped images insert at the drop point; existing links are editable (prefilled href,
  clear-to-remove); clearer toolbar labels (text for Table / list / quote / code / divider); the
  Markdown/Review toggle trails the buttons inline.
- **fix(toc):** a heading that slugifies to nothing (e.g. `## !!!`) no longer emits an invalid `id=""`.

## v1.1.9 — 2026-06-24 (Docker self-host: fix fresh-install file permissions)
- **fix(docker): media uploads + ISR cache now work on a fresh self-host install.** The image runs
  as the unprivileged `node` user (uid 1000), but two paths were root-owned and unwritable, so a
  clean `docker compose up` failed at runtime:
  - **ISR/prerender cache** — Next 16 writes its segment cache under `.next/server/app/*` (not just
    `.next/cache`); the Dockerfile only chowned `.next/cache`, so revalidation failed with `EACCES`.
    Now `chown`s the whole `/app/.next` tree.
  - **Uploaded binaries** — Docker creates the `./data/uploads` bind mount as root, shadowing the
    image's chown, so posting an image/file failed with `EACCES`. Added a one-shot `init-uploads`
    service that fixes ownership (uid 1000) before the app starts.
- **chore: keep the bundled Docker stack's `./data/` out of git and lint.** Added `/data/` to
  `.gitignore` and `data/**` to the ESLint ignores so a `docker compose up` (which writes
  root-owned Postgres data there) no longer dirties the tree or breaks `npm run lint`.
- **Admin dotted-grid starts cleanly from the top-left edge** — one full gap of clear space before the
  first dot (`background-position` `-1px -1px` → `7.5px 7.5px`), no more dot crammed into the corner.

## v1.1.7 — 2026-06-23
- **Admin dotted-grid background tuned.** ~30% denser dots (tile `22px` → `15px`); light dots a touch
  dimmer (`0.13` → `0.11`), dark dots a touch clearer (`0.11` → `0.12`).

## v1.1.6 — 2026-06-23
- **In-page ToC meta drops the comment count.** The label is just `Comments` (`Tags / Categories /
  Comments`), no number — the count lived on the ISR-cached page so it was always stale; the
  authoritative count is in `/admin/comments`.

## v1.1.5 — 2026-06-23
- **Admin Comments table reworked.** The content cell now clamps to two lines and click-toggles to
  the full comment (click again to collapse) — per row, so replies (flat rows) expand independently.
  The post-title cell wraps instead of truncating, so long rows are no longer cut off. The **From**
  (provider) column is replaced by an **IP** column showing the commenter IP with the ISO country
  code in parens (`1.2.3.4 (VN)`); pre-feature rows show `—`.
- **Comments now persist the commenter IP + country** (`author_ip` / `author_country`, new nullable
  columns) — captured at submit (country is best-effort from the Vercel edge, blank off-platform).
  Admin-only: NEVER included in the public comment tree.
- **fix: in-page ToC meta shows the comment count as `Comments (N)`** (was `N Comments`); still hidden
  entirely at 0 (`Tags / Categories / Comments`). The count is part of the ISR-cached post page, so it
  refreshes on the next revalidation (≤1h) or when the post is next edited — not instantly on a new comment.

## v1.1.4 — 2026-06-23
- **fix: the no-cloud Docker stack, hardened by a real end-to-end boot test.** Brought the full
  `docker compose` stack up and fixed three issues a build-only check missed:
  - **No more `--env-file` footgun.** The compose file no longer uses `${...}` interpolation, so a
    plain `docker compose up -d` (or any compose command) reads every value straight from
    `.env.docker` — previously, forgetting `--env-file` silently recreated PostgREST with a blank
    JWT secret and broke auth. `gen-keys.mjs` now emits `PGPASSWORD` + `PGRST_JWT_SECRET` (the names
    PostgREST/libpq read directly); the DB URI carries no password.
  - **ISR cache is writable.** The runner now `mkdir`s + `chown`s `/app/.next/cache` for the `node`
    user — the standalone image ships `.next/static` as root but never `.next/cache`, so the first
    request hit `EACCES` trying to write the incremental cache.
  - **No duplicate env keys.** `.env.docker.example` dropped its empty `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=` /
    secret placeholders, so `gen-keys.mjs >> .env.docker` appends exactly one of each.
  Verified live: `service_role` SELECT → 200 and INSERT → 201, `anon` write → 401, the app homepage
  renders through supabase-js → bundled PostgREST, and `docker compose` runs warning-free.

## v1.1.3 — 2026-06-23
- **feat: Docker self-host needs NO cloud — bundled Postgres + PostgREST.** The compose stack now
  ships its own database, so a self-hoster never signs up for Supabase. Because the app only ever
  uses Supabase's REST layer (no Supabase Auth/Realtime/Storage), the stack is just **Postgres +
  PostgREST** (2 light containers): supabase-js points at the local PostgREST and the **entire data
  layer stays byte-for-byte unchanged**. The only code change is 3 env-gated lines in `db.ts` —
  when `POSTGREST_DIRECT=1` it strips the `/rest/v1` path prefix so supabase-js reaches bare
  PostgREST (no proxy container). Postgres applies `scripts/schema.sql` + a role/grant bootstrap
  (`docker/initdb/`) on first boot; `scripts/docker/gen-keys.mjs` mints the DB password + JWT secret
  + `service_role` key. Text now lives in `./data/postgres`, binaries in `./data/uploads` — back up
  those two folders. Managed-DB users can still point `SUPABASE_URL` at a real Supabase and drop the
  `db`/`rest` services. **Vercel is unchanged** (no `POSTGREST_DIRECT` → hits Supabase as before).

## v1.1.2 — 2026-06-23
- **feat: Docker self-host, from the same codebase.** `src/lib/blob.ts` is now a storage facade
  with two drivers picked by `STORAGE_DRIVER`: `vercel-blob` (unchanged default) and `local`
  (filesystem). The local driver (`blob-local.ts`) writes binaries to a mounted volume and serves
  them at `/uploads` (`app/uploads/[...path]`). The browser upload path mirrors this via
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_DRIVER`: off Vercel the bytes are POSTed to a server route
  (`/api/media/upload`, `/api/files/attach`) instead of client-direct-to-store — a Node host has
  no 4.5 MB body cap. Ships `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` (app + an hourly cron sidecar that
  pings `/api/cron`) + `.env.docker.example`; `next.config` gains `output: 'standalone'`. The image
  builds with **no backend env** (the data layer already degrades to empty), so it stays portable.
  **The Vercel deploy is byte-for-byte unchanged** — it ignores the Dockerfile and keeps Vercel Blob.
- **feat: backup is storage-driver aware.** `backup.ts` reads each blob through the driver
  (`readBlob`) instead of self-fetching the public URL, so a snapshot works under the local driver
  too. Google Drive stays the only backup target.
- **chore: `check:no-direct-blob`** added to `check:all` — `@vercel/blob` may be imported only by
  `blob.ts` (and `@vercel/blob/client` only by the client-upload files), so a self-host build can't
  silently depend on the Vercel SDK.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-06-23 (stable)
- **First STABLE release since `v1.0.15`** (`v1.1.0-beta` was a prerelease, not a stable cut). Rolls
  up everything since v1.0.15:
  - **Reader comments** — manual/instant (no cache), optional Cloudflare Turnstile, Google/Facebook
    commenter login, admin-managed keys, and **optimistic posting** + a route loading skeleton.
  - **Admin overhaul** — shared UI kit, dotted canvas, 5-tab settings; the **activity log** now also
    records server errors.
  - **Reworked post ToC** — "Tiêu đề" header, in-page jumps, collapsible on every viewport.
  - **Editable footer** with a tiny bold/italic/underline/link markdown editor.
  - **Reading-optimized typography defaults** + read time now on every list post (backfill).
  - **Site-wide motion engine** — subtle, token-gated, one admin switch; respects reduced-motion.
  - **Palette refresh** — true-neutral Mono, **Sci-Fi** replaces Rosé; per-palette visibility.
  - **Hardening** — one-command `check:all` + seam tests, single-source `liveOnly` soft-delete,
    force-no-store admin reads, iOS notch progress-bar fix.
  - Detail in the dated entries below.
- **fix(type): removed `text-wrap: balance`/`pretty`.** Both re-broke whole lines and left too much
  empty space on the right (titles wrapped early; body looked under-set). Text now wraps normally,
  filling each line to the measure. Don't reintroduce them.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — activity log: errors now recorded + flagged)
- **feat: the activity log now captures server errors.** `logError` (the central route catch
  handler) schedules `after(() => logActivityError("METHOD /path", message))`, writing an
  `error`-action entry (same `activity_log` table, gated by the same `features.activityLog` toggle,
  never throws). Unexpected failures are now visible in **Admin → Log**, rendered with a red badge.
  Only genuine errors land here — validation 400s use `fail()`, not `logError`. `v1.1.0-beta`.
- **fix: many list posts showed no read time.** List views use the stored `posts.reading_minutes`
  column (the body isn't fetched for lists), and imported posts had it `null`. Added
  `scripts/backfill-reading-time.mjs` (mirrors `lib/utils.ts` `readingMinutes`; `--dry`/`--all`,
  idempotent) and ran it — 44 posts backfilled, 0 remain null. App saves already set the column, so
  this is a one-off repair. `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — palettes: true-neutral Mono, drop Rosé, add Sci-Fi)
- **fix(palette): Mono is now truly hueless.** The old values had a faint warm/blue cast (cream
  `bg`/`rule`, slightly blue `text`/`meta`), so the menu hover looked tinted. All pure gray now, and
  `rule` is a touch lighter so the hover reads as a soft, colourless gray.
- **change(palette): removed Rosé, added Sci-Fi** — a cool graphite surface with an electric-cyan
  accent (the deep blue-black + bright cyan dark mode is where it shines). Saved settings migrate
  cleanly: `sanitizeThemes`/`sanitizeEnabledPalettes` keep only known preset ids, so a stored `rose`
  is dropped and `scifi` seeded on next save. Names localized in all 6 languages. Still 6 palettes.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — UI fixes: logo cursor, title wrapping, admin dots)
- **fix: the header logo/wordmark now shows the pointer (hand) cursor**, not the text caret
  (`cursor-pointer` on the brand link).
- **fix: titles no longer wrap too early.** Dropped `text-wrap: balance` on headings — it shortened
  lines and left a premature right rag on list-card titles. Body keeps `text-wrap: pretty`.
- **change: the admin dotted canvas is more visible** in both light and dark (dot opacity + size up).
- **feat(comments): a posted comment now appears instantly (optimistic).** It's rendered with the
  SAME `renderCommentMarkdown` the server uses — so there's no content drift — overlaid on the tree
  via the new, tested `lib/comment-tree.ts` `mergeOptimisticComments`, then the authoritative refetch
  replaces it and clears the overlay. A failed POST removes the optimistic comment and shows the
  error. (Supersedes the old "refetch only" note; the refetch is still the source of truth.) The
  composer + sign-in buttons moved to `CommentForm.tsx` to keep files focused.
- **feat: a themed loading skeleton for blog routes** (`(blog)/loading.tsx` + `.skeleton`) for
  instant feedback on navigation. The subtle pulse follows the motion engine (gated by `data-motion`
  + `prefers-reduced-motion`), so it degrades to a calm static placeholder; sized to roughly match a
  post so the swap to real content barely shifts. `v1.1.0-beta`.
- **feat: a site-wide motion engine for a calmer, more "app-like" feel.** ONE set of tokens
  (`--dur-fast/base/slow` + `--ease`) drives every transition/animation across the public site AND
  admin. A single switch gates all of it: `<html data-motion>` is server-rendered from a new
  `settings.motion.enabled` (default on; no flash, no client JS), and BOTH `data-motion="off"` and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` collapse every duration to `0s` — instant, no per-component branching.
  Toggle in **Admin → Appearance → Rendering**.
- **What moves (kept subtle):** eased hover/focus/colour changes + a tiny press-squash on buttons;
  cross-fade page navigations via Next `experimental.viewTransition` + `::view-transition-*(root)`
  CSS; a gentle scroll-reveal on list cards (`.reveal`). All use cheap `opacity`/`transform` only —
  **no CLS, no render-blocking, no added client bundle** — and degrade to instant/visible where
  unsupported (the reveal is guarded behind `@supports (animation-timeline)` + `data-motion='on'`).
- **chore:** the file-size guard now also exempts the `src/locales/` i18n dictionaries (cohesive
  DATA manifests, like the already-exempt `types.ts`) — adding UI strings no longer trips the cap.
  `v1.1.0-beta`.
- **feat: the site footer is now owner-editable.** New `settings.footer` holds limited inline
  markdown — **bold / italic / underline / link** only — rendered by `lib/inline-md.ts`
  (escape-first like `comment-md`: the whole string is escaped, so only the `<strong>/<em>/<u>/<a>`
  we inject can appear; link hrefs are protocol-checked, `javascript:`/`data:` fall back to plain
  text). `{year}` and `{title}` tokens expand at render. Authored in **Admin → Settings → Site**
  via `FooterField` (textarea + a B/I/U/Link toolbar that wraps the selection + a live preview).
  The public layout renders it in `<footer class="site-footer">`; default = the old "© {year}
  {title} · powered by Quire Blog" line. Pinned by `inline-md.test.ts` (render + link-safety + escape
  + length). i18n in all 6 admin locales. `v1.1.0-beta`.
- **change(typography): retuned the default type scale for long-form reading** (the Reset target).
  Restrained, monotonic heading scale (h1 2.0 → h5 1.0; h5 was 0.9, *below* body — fixed), body
  leading eased 1.75 → 1.7 for an even grey column, code 1.65 → 1.6, h2 1.4 → 1.5 for clearer
  hierarchy. ~66-char measure (`contentWidth` 672) kept — already in the 60–75 cpl comfort zone.
  Updated in BOTH `globals.css :root` and `DEFAULT_TYPOGRAPHY`; readers who customized keep theirs.
- **feat(typography): `text-wrap` polish.** Headings get `text-wrap: balance` (no lone short last
  line), `.prose p` gets `text-wrap: pretty` (better rag) — both progressive, ignored where unsupported.
- **refactor: removed the last hardcoded public text sizes.** Brand wordmark `text-lg` → `.fs-h4`;
  Theme/Palette toggle menu items `text-sm` → `.t-small`; `PostCard` excerpt `leading-relaxed` +
  inline `font-size` → new `.t-body` utility (body role outside `.prose`). Public size grep is now clean.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — admin overhaul: dotted canvas, shared UI kit, 5-tab settings)
- **feat(admin): a shared UI kit ends the per-page drift.** New `components/admin/kit.tsx` is the
  ONE source for admin chrome — `Card` (canonical surface), `PageHeader` (the title block every
  screen reuses, replacing a copy-pasted `<h1>` on each page), `Tabs` (one component for the
  `underline` + `segment` styles), `StatCard`, `EmptyState`, and table tokens (`TableFrame`/`THEAD`/
  `TROW`). Cards were `rounded-2xl p-5` in Settings but `rounded-xl p-4` elsewhere; now uniform.
  Migrated Overview, Content dashboard, Comments, Trash, Analytics, Activity log + the Media page.
- **feat(admin): a dotted-grid canvas.** `<main>` carries `.admin-canvas` (globals.css) — a CSS
  radial-gradient dot grid, fixed faint neutral per light/dark mode; sidebar + cards float above it.
- **feat(admin): the Overview shows more.** Stat row adds **Comments** (next to Posts/Pages) and
  every tile links to its section; plus a **Quick actions** row and a **Recent activity** card
  (latest 6, gated by `features.activityLog`). The System panel moves to the bottom.
- **feat(admin): Settings regrouped into 5 task-based tabs** — **Site / Content / Appearance / SEO /
  Integrations** (was General / Appearance / Advanced) — so each tab holds 1–2 cards instead of
  cramming five. Still ONE form + ONE save. The Drive-connect redirect now lands on `integrations`.
- **change(admin): the collapse control moved to the top** next to the wordmark (a compact chrome
  button, not a nav row) so it's no longer mistaken for Sign out, which now sits alone under a divider.
- **change(admin): palette selection is frontend-only.** The admin chrome dropped its `PaletteToggle`
  (only light/dark remains); the Appearance tab still sets the site default + reader-switchable
  palettes, with an in-place note. i18n synced across all 6 admin locales. `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — ToC panel: "Tiêu đề", combined jump, collapsible everywhere)
- **feat(blog): the post ToC is reworked.** Its title is now **"Tiêu đề"** (Headings) instead of
  "Mục lục"/"Contents" in all 6 locales, and **clicking the title scrolls back to the top**. Under
  the headings, **one line** joins the present **tags / categories / comments** labels and jumps to
  the first existing section (scroll-only, via a shared `TOC_ANCHORS` map + `scroll-mt-24` targets).
  The panel is now **collapsible on every viewport** from a **text-free left-edge handle** (the tab
  shape speaks for itself): default **open + pinned on desktop**, default **closed on mobile**
  (outside-tap / Escape dismiss). When a post has **no headings** the header is a plain,
  non-clickable **"Mục lục"** (`tocIndex`) and only the jump line shows; the panel disappears only
  when there is nothing at all to show. The **comments** label carries its **count in front**
  (e.g. "12 Bình luận", server-rendered). Solid `bg-bg` background so it never shows content
  through; clickable items now get a pointer cursor; phones gain wider side gutters
  (`px-8 sm:px-5`) so the handle clears the text. `v1.1.0-beta`.
- **fix(blog): the jump link pointed at `#undefined`.** `TOC_ANCHORS` was exported from the
  `'use client'` `Toc` module and imported into the Server Component post page; a Server Component
  importing a plain const from a client module gets a client-reference proxy, so `TOC_ANCHORS.tags`
  read as `undefined` on the server — rendering `href="#undefined"` and matching `id="undefined"`
  anchor targets (no build error, since the proxy doesn't throw). Moved `TOC_ANCHORS` to a plain
  `lib/toc.ts` that both sides import. `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — comment integrations: setup help + links in the admin)
- **feat(admin): each comment integration now shows a one-line setup guide + a link.** Turnstile →
  Cloudflare dashboard; Facebook → Meta for Developers (create app, add Facebook Login, redirect
  `/api/auth/callback/facebook`); Google → a note that it reuses your sign-in and that **letting
  OUTSIDE readers in requires publishing the OAuth consent screen to "Production"** (in "Testing"
  only the owner can sign in), with a link to the Google Cloud consent screen. i18n in all 6 admin
  locales. `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — comments: a too-deep reply is a clean 400, not a 500)
- **fix(comments): replying past the 3-tier limit (or to a missing parent) now returns 400, not
  500.** Found in a live end-to-end pass on manhhung.me — the depth guard worked but `addComment`
  threw a generic `Error` that fell through to the 500 handler. It now throws a typed
  `CommentInputError` the route maps to 400 with a clear message. Pinned by `comments.test.ts`
  (depth-limit / missing-parent / empty-body guards). `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — comment integration keys move into the admin)
- **feat: Turnstile + Facebook keys are entered in Admin → Settings, not env.** The optional comment
  integrations no longer need a Vercel redeploy to configure. Keys are SECRETS, kept in a new
  server-only `integration_keys` table (single row) — like `backup_state`, **never in
  `settings.data`** — set via an owner-gated `POST /api/comments/keys` (`CommentKeys.tsx`). Env vars
  of the same name still work as a fallback. **Google stays env-only** (it's the owner's admin
  sign-in — moving it to the admin would deadlock the owner's own login); its toggle just shows the
  "Sign in with Google" button, now clearly described as *letting outside readers sign in*.
- **refactor(auth): NextAuth config is a function so Facebook reads its keys from the DB at runtime;
  the edge middleware now reads the JWT via `getToken`** (new `lib/auth-shared.ts` holds the pure
  `isAuthorized`), so the Supabase client never enters the edge bundle. `getCommentEnv()` is now
  async (reads the key store). Behaviour-preserving for existing env-based setups. `schema.sql`
  updated; `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — reader comments, Phase C: Google/Facebook login)
- **feat(comments): readers can comment with a Google or Facebook account.** Toggles in
  Admin → Settings (each effective only when its env keys exist — "needs env key" badge). A
  signed-in commenter sees "Commenting as <name>" + a plain comment box: **no name/email fields and
  no Turnstile** — the server **trusts the session** (`getCommenter()`) for identity + provider.
  Logged-out readers still get the manual form **plus** sign-in buttons. Facebook is a new
  commenter-only NextAuth provider (`AUTH_FACEBOOK_ID/SECRET`); Google doubles as the owner's admin
  sign-in. The session now carries `name` + `provider` (`next-auth.d.ts` augmentation); the viewer is
  resolved client-side via `/api/auth/session` since the post page is static. **Signing in to comment
  does NOT grant admin** — `/admin` stays gated to `AUTHORIZED_EMAIL`. i18n: all 6 public + admin
  locales. This completes the 3-phase comment system. `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — reader comments, Phase B: Cloudflare Turnstile)
- **feat(comments): optional Cloudflare Turnstile anti-spam for manual comments.** Toggle in
  Admin → Settings (under Comments). The manual form gates the comment box **behind a Turnstile
  pass** — the widget appears once name/email are filled, and only then does the message box show.
  The POST **verifies the token server-side** (siteverify, fail closed). Enforced **only when the
  toggle is on AND `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is set**, so turning it on without keys never locks out
  commenting — the admin row shows a "needs env key" badge (`getCommentEnv()` reports which
  integrations are wired; the public SITE key is passed to the widget, no secret leaves the server).
  New `lib/turnstile.ts` + `lib/comment-env.ts` + `components/blog/Turnstile.tsx`; env
  `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` / `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (`.env.example` + README). `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — reader comments, Phase A: manual identity, instant, no cache)
- **feat: a text-only reader comment system, off by default (`settings.comments.enabled`).** Phase A
  of three (B = Cloudflare Turnstile, C = Google/Facebook login). What ships now:
  - **Public:** a comment block under each post — name + email + optional website, **limited markdown
    (bold/italic only)**, replies up to **3 tiers**, 1000-char cap. It's a CLIENT island that fetches
    `/api/comments` with `no-store`; the post page stays ISR, a new comment **shows instantly with no
    cache in the way and NO `revalidatePath`** (commenting never touches the ISR path).
  - **Admin → Comments:** every comment (content/post/time/name/from/delete); delete = soft delete →
    **Trash** (restore/purge in a new Comments tab). Settings → General has an **Enable comments**
    toggle. The posts table shows a **comment-count column** when enabled.
  - **Safety:** markdown is escape-first so no link/image/script/raw-HTML survives (Invariant 5);
    email is stored but NEVER sent to the public client; depth enforced server-side; published-post
    check + per-IP rate limit; `/api/comments` is the only public-exempt path, `[id]` DELETE stays
    owner-gated. New table `comments` (+ `schema.sql`). Tests: `comment-md`, `buildCommentTree`,
    `sanitizeComments`. `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — per-palette visibility; switcher hides when one is left)
- **feat(appearance): the owner can turn each color palette on/off for visitors.** New
  `settings.enabledPalettes` (allow-list of preset ids). Admin → Appearance shows a "Shown to
  visitors" checkbox per palette; the default palette is locked on so the set is never empty.
  The public + admin palette switcher lists only enabled palettes (`enabledPaletteOptions`), and
  **`PaletteToggle` renders nothing when ≤1 palette is enabled** — so a one-palette site has no
  theme-switch icon at all. The no-FOUC script ignores a stored palette that is no longer enabled
  (falls back to the default, no flash). Disabled palettes remain fully editable. Migration-safe:
  legacy settings with no `enabledPalettes` read as "all on" (`sanitizeEnabledPalettes`, pinned by
  `settings-sanitize.test.ts`). `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.1.0-beta — soft-delete filter is enforced in one place)
- **refactor: `liveOnly()` (in `lib/db.ts`) is the single home of the soft-delete predicate.**
  Every live read of a soft-deletable table (posts/pages/media/files) now wraps its query in
  `liveOnly(...)` instead of hand-writing `.is('deleted_at', null)` at each of the 9 call sites —
  so the column + null check are defined ONCE and can't drift. Trash views still read the complement
  (`.not('deleted_at','is',null)`) directly. Behaviour-preserving; the `soft-delete.test.ts` suite
  (listing/public/search/single) guards it. First tagged **beta** of the 1.1 line. `v1.1.0-beta`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.0.18 — verification is one command now, not a reading session)
- **build: `npm run check:all` is the Definition of Done** — typecheck + lint + four static
  invariant checks (`check:routes`, `check:filesize`, `check:no-any`, `check:token-bust`) + the
  vitest suite, all offline/no-creds. Codifies the manual greps that lived in `CHECKLIST.md` /
  `audit/README.md`. A separate `check:consistency:live` cross-checks the `media`/`files` rows
  against the real Blob store (skips cleanly without `.env.local`).
- **test: a minimal vitest seam suite (62 tests, <0.5s)** pinning the load-bearing invariants —
  blob collapse/expand round-trip, shared slug namespace, revalidate SUPERSET, markdown raw-HTML
  escaping + ToC anchor sync, and soft-delete (trashed content never leaks to a live read). Not
  broad coverage by design.
- **refactor: split two oversized modules under the 400-line cap (behaviour-preserving)** —
  `lib/media.ts` → `lib/image.ts` (pure sharp encoding) and `lib/settings.ts` →
  `lib/settings-sanitize.ts` (pure validation/migration); both one-way imports, all re-exports kept.
- **docs: CLAUDE.md restructured for debugging (504 → 199 lines)** — a per-area DEBUG ROUTER + a
  numbered Invariants list (each with its enforcing test/guard) up front; topic detail moved to
  `docs/{conventions,features,seo-pwa,mcp,backups}.md`, loaded on demand. No runtime change. `v1.0.18`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.0.17 — admin live reads were silently served from the 1h Data Cache)
- **fix(admin): the MCP token list (and every admin live read) could show STALE data —
  most visibly an empty token list after connecting a connector from Claude.** Root cause:
  `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` does NOT de-cache our `db()` GET reads, because they opt into the
  Data Cache with an explicit `next: { revalidate, tags:['db'] }` — Next only auto-de-caches
  force-dynamic fetches that set NO revalidate (`noFetchConfigAndForceDynamic` in `patch-fetch`).
  So a tagged read stayed in the 1h Data Cache, and an OAuth token minted out-of-band (which
  intentionally does not purge tag `db`) never appeared. Added `export const fetchCache =
  'force-no-store'` — the lever that forces every fetch in a segment to `no-store` regardless of
  its options — to the `/admin` layout (cascades to all admin pages) and the owner-only live API
  routes (`api/mcp/tokens`, `api/files`, `api/media`, `api/media/unused`,
  `api/posts/[slug]/revisions`, `api/backup`). Public pages keep their cached/ISR reads (they set
  neither config). Same class of bug as the 1.0.11–1.0.13 "Backups stuck on Connect". `v1.0.17`.

## 2026-06-23 (v1.0.16 — reading progress bar reaches the top edge on notch/Dynamic Island)
- **fix(ios): the reading progress bar sat below the Dynamic Island / notch instead of at the
  true top edge.** Without `viewport-fit=cover`, iOS Safari lays the page out inside the safe area,
  so the bar's `top: 0` landed at the top of the *content* area (under the island), looking like it
  floated mid-screen. Set `viewportFit: 'cover'` in `generateViewport` so the page fills under the
  island and the fixed bar reaches the real top edge, and added `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding on
  `body` so the header/content re-clear the island (env() is 0 on devices without insets, so no
  effect elsewhere). `v1.0.16`.
- **docs(readme): rewrote "What it is"** to lead with the actual pitch — open-source (MIT),
  built for people who just want to **write**, **fast load on mobile + desktop**, **readable
  typography**, and **easy to tweak from the admin with no hardcoded values**. Gave the feature
  table a real header row (`Area | What you get`) instead of the blank `&nbsp;` cells.
- **docs(readme): both "Get your own" paths now open by default** (the AI-agent path was
  collapsed and easy to miss). **The agent path now has the agent walk the owner through creating
  the Google OAuth "Web" client** (Cloud Console clicks, consent screen, redirect URI) and collect
  the client ID/secret back, instead of telling the owner to pre-create it alone. `v1.0.15`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.14 — fix Backups card stuck on "Connect" after connecting)
- **fix(backup): the Backups card kept showing "Connect Google Drive" after a successful
  connect** (and "Back up now" stayed disabled). Root cause: the `backup_state` read is Data-Cache-
  eligible (tag `db`, 1h), and the connect write (`setDriveAuth`) didn't `revalidateTag('db')`, so
  `GET /api/backup` served the stale pre-connect "not connected" state until the cache expired.
  `setDriveAuth` / `clearDriveAuth` / `setFolderId` / `recordRun` now bust the `db` tag, so the
  admin reflects connect / disconnect / run / last-status immediately (confirmed via Supabase API
  logs: no `backup_state` re-read occurred after the connect writes). Also added a focus/visibility
  refetch to `BackupFields` so it re-syncs after the OAuth round-trip. `v1.0.14`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.13 — fix Drive connect redirect + tidy Backups layout)
- **fix(backup): `redirect_uri_mismatch` connecting Google Drive.** The consent + token-exchange
  redirect URI was built from `req.nextUrl.origin`, which is a `*.vercel.app` host when the admin
  is reached there (sign-in still works because NextAuth uses `AUTH_URL`) — so it didn't match the
  one URI registered on the OAuth client. New `backupRedirectUri(settings)` derives it from the
  canonical `resolveSiteUrl(settings)` (e.g. `https://manhhung.me/api/backup/callback`), used by
  both `/api/backup/connect` and `/api/backup/callback`. Register that exact URI on the client.
- **ui(backup): the Backups card no longer spans full width.** It now sits in the same two-column
  Advanced grid as MCP + custom CSS, so the section reads evenly. `v1.0.13`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.12 — slugified taxonomy URLs + clearer Overview)
- **fix(seo): category/tag URLs now use the slugified term**, e.g. `/category/suy-nghi` instead of
  `/category/Suy%20ngh%C4%A9`. New `lib/taxonomy.ts` (`termSlug`/`resolveTerm`); post-footer links +
  sitemap emit `termSlug(term)`; the four `category|tag/[slug]` routes resolve the slug back to the
  term (by `slugify` match) and `notFound()` on no match. **Old `%`-encoded URLs still resolve**
  (back-compat raw-term match) so nothing 404s. OG/metadata show the real term name.
- **feat(admin): Overview is clearer.** The media stat card now reads **Images** = original count,
  with a sub-line `N variants · M files` (variants = derived `-thumb`/`-1024`/`-1600` AVIF/WebP;
  files = `files/` blobs) instead of one opaque "Attachments" total. Category/Tag cards show their
  **total count** in the title. The System panel adds **MCP server** (on/off) and **Backups**
  (on when enabled + Drive connected) rows. New `stat*`/`sys*` locale keys in all 6 languages. `v1.0.12`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.11 — full-site backups to Google Drive)
- **feat: full-site backup to the owner's Google Drive** (Admin → Settings → Advanced). One
  snapshot = a single self-contained `.tar.gz` — `db.json` (every text table) + `blob/<pathname>`
  (every binary) + `manifest.json`. Automatic on a schedule (cron, every `intervalDays`, default
  4) with retention (keep the newest `keep`, default 4), plus **Back up now / Restore / Delete**
  in the admin. New `lib/backup.ts` + `lib/gdrive.ts` + `lib/backup-state.ts`; routes
  `/api/backup` (status/run/delete), `/api/backup/restore`, `/api/backup/{connect,callback,disconnect}`.
  Cron (`/api/cron`) calls `maybeRunBackup()`.
- **Drive auth is separate from sign-in.** A dedicated `drive.file` OAuth consent (reuses the
  Google client; login scope untouched) stores a refresh token in the new **`backup_state`** table
  (single row). The token is a SECRET and is kept OUT of `settings.data` (which is sent to the
  client) — only non-secret config (`enabled`/`intervalDays`/`keep`) rides in `settings.backups`;
  status + the snapshot list come from owner-only `/api/backup` (never the token).
- **Restore** replaces every text table (settings upserted; others delete-all + insert with
  `id`/generated `search` stripped) and re-uploads every blob; a pre-restore snapshot is taken
  first. New `backups` activity actions; new `backup*` admin locale keys in all 6 languages; new
  `tar` dependency. Owner one-time setup: enable the Google Drive API + add the callback redirect
  URI to the OAuth client, then **Connect Google Drive**. `v1.0.11`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.10 — hardening: edge guard, Google-only, MCP token expiry)
- **feat(security): `src/middleware.ts` edge owner-guard (defense-in-depth).** Reads the NextAuth
  JWT and blocks `/admin/:path*` (→ sign-in) and owner-only `/api/:path*` (→ 401) BEFORE the route
  runs — so a new admin page or API route is protected even if it forgets `requireOwner()`. Self-
  authed/public paths are allow-listed (`/api/auth`, `/api/cron`, `/api/track`, `/api/search`,
  `/api/mcp` except `/api/mcp/tokens`); add new public/bearer routes to `isPublicApi()`.
- **change(auth): Google is now the ONLY sign-in provider.** Dropped the GitHub OAuth provider
  (`auth.ts`, `.env.example`, README). `AUTH_GITHUB_ID/SECRET` are no longer read.
- **feat(security): MCP tokens now expire 180 days after creation.** New `mcp_tokens.expires_at`
  column (migration `mcp_tokens_add_expires_at`; default in `schema.sql`); `createToken` /
  `mintOAuthToken` set it on insert; `verifyTokenHash` rejects an expired bearer. The admin token
  table shows an **Expires** column (red "Expired" when past). Connectors silently re-authorize
  across the boundary; a manual token must be recreated. New locale keys `mcpColExpires` / `mcpExpired`
  in all 6 languages. The admin remains the sole authority over deletion. `v1.0.10`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.9 — every error page shares one look)
- **refactor: all error/edge screens now route through ONE `ErrorScreen` component** so they can't
  drift. The public 404, the 5xx boundaries (`ErrorView`), and a new **admin 404**
  (`app/admin/not-found.tsx`, for unmatched admin URLs) all render the identical layout (number +
  title + text + actions on theme tokens) — fully consistent per request. Shared `ERROR_LINK` class.
- The public 404 keeps the blog header/footer; the admin 404 renders in the admin shell. (Other 4xx
  like 401/403 stay auth redirects/JSON by design, not pages.) `v1.0.9`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.8 — fix stale admin lists + 5xx/error pages)
- **fix(admin): admin list endpoints showed STALE data (the real "can't delete a token" bug).**
  `db()` GET reads are Data-Cache-eligible (tag `db`, 1h). The admin client-fetched list routes
  weren't `force-dynamic`, so after a delete/upload the cached list still showed the old rows — the
  MCP token list kept showing a just-deleted token, so re-clicking Delete was a no-op on a dead id
  (only toggling MCP off, which calls `revalidateTag('db')`, refreshed it). Marked **`force-dynamic`**
  on every owner-only list route so they always read live: `mcp/tokens`, `files`, `media`,
  `media/unused`, `posts/[slug]/revisions`. Deleting a connection from the admin now takes effect
  immediately, as intended.
- **fix(admin): corrected `api/media` GET header comment** (said "public read" — it is owner-only).
- **feat: 5xx / error pages now match the 404.** Added `error.tsx` (per-segment) + `(blog)/error.tsx`
  (keeps the public shell) + `global-error.tsx` (root-layout failures), all rendering a shared
  `ErrorView` styled identically to the 404 (number + title + text + Try again / Back home, on theme
  tokens). New locale keys `errorTitle`/`errorText`/`tryAgain` in all 6 languages. `v1.0.8`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.7 — MCP: admin is the sole authority over a connection)
- **change(mcp): OAuth tokens are NEVER auto-deleted.** Removed the rolling-window prune
  (`MAX_OAUTH_TOKENS`) — the system no longer removes connections behind the owner's back.
  Lifecycle rule now matches intent: a connection **persists forever** (eternal token, no expiry,
  no prune) until the **owner deletes it in the admin**; an admin delete is final unless the owner
  re-authorizes. Deleting the connector in Claude alone just lets it re-authorize (a new token row;
  the old one persists until the owner removes it). `v1.0.7`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.6 — MCP token list always reflects reality)
- **fix(admin): the MCP token list no longer shows a stale snapshot.** It loaded only on mount, so
  connecting/disconnecting in Claude (out-of-band) left the admin list wrong — "can't delete the old
  one", "don't see the new one". It now **refetches on tab focus / visibility change** and has a
  manual **Refresh** button, so the owner always sees and can revoke every live token/connection.
- **fix(mcp): prune the OAuth rolling window by `id` (monotonic PK), not `created_at`** — removes a
  tie risk where a freshly minted token could be pruned. `v1.0.6`.
- Note: deleting a connector's token revokes that session; the connector can only re-appear if the
  owner re-approves OAuth (authorize is gated by the owner's login). To fully stop access, also
  disconnect in Claude or turn the MCP toggle off.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.5 — MCP: authorize once, connect forever)
- **fix(mcp): connecting an OAuth connector once now works indefinitely.** The `/token` exchange
  used to delete the previous "OAuth connector" token on every connect (single slot), so any
  reconnect or second client stranded an earlier session on a dead token → "connected but zero
  tools". Now `mintOAuthToken` **never pre-deletes** (the in-use token survives a re-auth) and keeps
  a small rolling window (`MAX_OAUTH_TOKENS`), so reconnects can't strand a client. Tokens stay
  eternal (no expiry), so claude.ai authorizes once and never has to re-auth.
- **fix(mcp): OAuth tokens are exempt from the manual 5-token cap.** Authorizing can no longer fail
  with "limit reached"; the admin create-token cap counts manual tokens only (`McpTokenInfo.oauth`).
- **docs:** corrected the stale `api/mcp/route.ts` header (it still described a single `MCP_TOKEN`
  bearer) and the CLAUDE.md MCP section. `v1.0.5`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.4 — full-width admin + non-wrapping table headers)
- **feat(admin): admin pages now fill the browser width.** Dropped the `max-w-6xl` lock on the
  admin content column (no longer needed with the column/sidebar layout) — content is full width
  with ~100px gutters on desktop (`lg:px-[100px]`), tighter padding on mobile (`px-4`, `sm:px-6`).
  The fixed save bars (post/page editor, settings) align to the same gutters.
- **fix(admin): table column headers no longer wrap.** Added `whitespace-nowrap` to every admin
  table header row (posts, pages, trash, activity log); columns auto-size to content (auto table
  layout) instead of squeezing a header onto two lines.
- **polish(admin): mobile spacing.** Re-tuned the content gutters/top padding for phones alongside
  the width change. `v1.0.4`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.3 — slim down: dead scripts + deps + comments)
- **chore: removed `@vercel/analytics`.** It duplicated the built-in cookieless analytics and
  shipped extra client JS; dropped the `<Analytics/>` tag + the package. The custom analytics
  (`analytics.ts`, Admin → Analytics) is unchanged.
- **chore: moved 12 pre-Supabase one-off scripts to `scripts/legacy/`** (kept for recovery, not
  deleted). Their parser deps (`gray-matter` → devDeps, `turndown`/`turndown-plugin-gfm`/
  `fast-xml-parser` already dev) no longer sit in production `dependencies`.
- **docs: trimmed verbose comments** across the data layer (`media`/`files`/`posts`/`settings`/
  `blob`/`themes`/`revalidate`) + `layout.tsx` / `PostContent.tsx` to terse, AI-readable notes —
  GOTCHAs and the "why" behind non-obvious decisions kept. No behavior change. `v1.0.3`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.2 — collapsible sidebar + admin polish)
- **feat(admin): the sidebar is now collapsible and icon-led.** Each nav item has an icon
  (`navIcons.tsx`); the rail is narrower (`w-52`, was `w-60`) and a toggle collapses it to
  icon-only (`w-16`), persisted in localStorage and remembered across navigation. Collapsed items
  show a tooltip; the footer controls switch to icon-only too. The fixed settings/editor save bars
  follow the rail via a `--admin-nav-w` CSS variable (no hardcoded offset). All monochrome — no
  hardcoded accent colors/fonts/text sizes, per the project rules.
- **polish(admin): softer cards + a mobile-safe analytics grid.** Added a subtle `shadow-sm` to the
  admin card containers (lifts white cards off the gray canvas, matching the reference) and made the
  Analytics summary cards stack on phones (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3`) instead of cramming three
  across. `v1.0.2`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.1 — admin-managed MCP + left sidebar)
- **feat(mcp): MCP is now toggled + tokenized from the admin.** Replaced the single `MCP_TOKEN`
  env var with an Admin → Settings → Advanced panel: an **enable toggle** (`settings.mcp.enabled`)
  and an **access-token manager** — generate up to **5 named tokens**, each shown **once** on
  creation (only its SHA-256 hash is stored in a new `mcp_tokens` table), with last-used time and
  one-click revoke. `verifyMcpToken` now checks the bearer's hash against live tokens while the
  toggle is on. The OAuth `/token` exchange mints a managed token (named "OAuth connector",
  refreshed per connect) instead of returning a static secret. New owner-only
  `/api/mcp/tokens` (+ `/[id]`) routes; activity actions `mcp.token.create|delete`.
- **feat(admin): left vertical sidebar nav.** The admin top bar grew too crowded, so navigation
  moved to a sticky left sidebar (brand → links → theme/palette/cache/sign-out pinned at the
  bottom), with active-route highlighting; it collapses to a hamburger drawer on mobile. New
  `AdminSidebar` (replaces `AdminHeader`); shared `SIDEBAR_NAV` constant keeps every item uniform.
- **change(settings): "Text rendering" moved from Advanced → Appearance.** Font smoothing now sits
  with the other appearance controls; Advanced holds the MCP panel + custom CSS. `v1.0.1`.

## 2026-06-22 (v1.0.0 — MCP server + Trash)
First stable release: the blog can now be operated by an AI agent over MCP, and every
delete is recoverable via a Trash.

### MCP server
- **feat(mcp): remote MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP).** An MCP client (Claude,
  ChatGPT, …) can operate the blog through the SAME data layer as the admin UI — tools to
  list/get/create/update/delete(→Trash)/restore posts and pages, manage media + files (incl.
  `add_media_from_url`), read taxonomy, and read settings. Content is Markdown verbatim (no
  conversion). Tools live in `src/lib/mcp`; built on `mcp-handler` + `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **feat(mcp): one full-access token + a thin OAuth layer.** Auth is a single bearer
  `MCP_TOKEN` ("one token, full power"); connectors that require OAuth obtain it via a minimal
  OAuth 2.1 flow (authorization-code + PKCE) gated by the owner's existing NextAuth login —
  `/api/mcp/{authorize,token,register}` + `/.well-known/oauth-{protected-resource,authorization-server}`.
  Unset `MCP_TOKEN` disables the endpoint entirely.
- **feat(mcp): sensitive settings are blocked.** `get_settings` reads everything, but
  `update_settings` exposes only a safe allowlist (title / description / showDescription) — theme,
  fonts, typography, menu, domain, SEO, language and logos cannot be changed over MCP.

### Trash / soft delete
- **feat(trash): every delete is now a soft delete to a recoverable Trash.** Posts, pages, media
  and files gain a nullable `deleted_at` column (NULL = live, timestamp = trashed). Deleting from
  anywhere (admin tables, media/file libraries, multi-select, "delete all unused") now MOVES the
  item to Trash instead of destroying it — every live read filters `deleted_at is null`, so trashed
  items vanish from the site, lists, search, sitemap/feed/llms and the libraries. Media/file soft
  delete KEEPS the blob, so a published post that links a trashed image keeps rendering; nothing is
  removed from Blob until an explicit purge. A trashed row keeps its slug (still reserved) so
  restore always works.
- **feat(trash): new Admin → Trash page (`/admin/trash`).** Four tabs (Posts / Pages / Media /
  Files), each its own list with **Restore** + **Delete permanently**, plus **Empty trash** per
  tab. Nothing auto-purges — permanent removal is manual only. New unified `POST /api/trash`
  (`{ kind, action: restore|purge|empty, ids? }`), owner-gated; restores revalidate the item's
  surfaces, media/file purges revalidate everything (blobs removed). New activity actions
  (`*.restore` / `*.purge` / `trash.empty`). i18n synced across all 6 locales. `v1.0.0`.

## 2026-06-22 (fix: duplicate favicon)
- **fix(favicon): emit exactly one `<link rel="icon">`.** Next auto-injects a `<link>` for
  `app/favicon.ico` **in addition to** the metadata `icons.icon`, so the page shipped two
  conflicting favicons (the bundled `vb` default declaring `sizes="256x256"` + the owner's custom
  one) and browsers often picked the wrong/bundled one — the custom favicon looked like it wasn't
  loading. Moved the default to `public/favicon.ico` (no auto-inject) and drive the icon solely via
  `generateMetadata` (`settings.faviconUrl || '/favicon.ico'`). `v0.9.29`.

## 2026-06-22 (audit fixes: self-hosted font, link hardening)
- **fix(build): self-host Inter — no more Google Fonts dependency.** Replaced `next/font/google`
  (which fetched Inter at build → broke offline / restricted-CI / Google-outage builds) with
  self-hosted variable woff2 (`public/fonts/`, subsetted by `unicode-range` in `globals.css`). The
  OG image already self-hosts the same Inter as `.woff`, so the whole app is now Google-free; one
  typeface everywhere, fully local. The latin subset is preloaded.
- **fix(security): sanitize link hrefs.** `PostContent` now drops `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:`
  link schemes (marked v5+ stopped sanitizing) — `[x](javascript:…)` no longer renders an
  executable href. Raw HTML was already escaped, so this closes the remaining vector.
- **fix(toc): de-dupe heading ids.** Two identical headings used to emit the same `id` (broken ToC
  anchors); now 2nd → `foo-2`, 3rd → `foo-3`, with `PostContent` and `extractHeadings` sharing the
  counter so anchors line up.
- **fix(auth): normalize the owner email** (trim + lowercase both sides) so a provider returning a
  different case / stray whitespace can't lock the owner out.
- **fix(images): parse image-placement fragments as exact tokens** (`#left`/`#right`/`#wide`/
  `#left-wide`) so a stray fragment like `#bright` no longer matches `right`.
- **chore: add `typecheck` script** (`tsc --noEmit`). `v0.9.28`.

## 2026-06-22 (docs: slim CLAUDE.md)
- **docs(claude): CLAUDE.md 560 → 358 lines (−36%) with zero rules lost.** Deduped the "why"
  (delegated to ARCHITECTURE.md via a header note), deleted the standalone Portability section
  (its rule lives in Blob; rationale in ARCHITECTURE), compressed the data-layer table + the
  descriptive sections (SEO/Editor/Settings/PWA/etc.) to essentials, and collapsed the legacy
  scripts table to a one-line list. Every HARD RULE and GOTCHA kept verbatim (caching DO-NOTs,
  header `h-9`/no-`items-baseline`, one-font + grep checks, `hr{margin:0}`, i18n sync, versioning).
- **docs(claude): fixed a stale contradiction** — removed the dangling "`blob.ts` readJson/readText
  return fallback" line; those were already removed in P1.5 (the doc said so two sections earlier).

## 2026-06-22 (docs: DB schema + working principles)
- **docs(setup): added `scripts/schema.sql`** — the full Postgres schema (all 9 tables,
  indexes, the `posts.search` generated tsvector, RLS, and the `analytics_summary`/
  `analytics_totals` RPCs), transcribed from the live database. Self-hosters can now create
  the whole DB in one run; previously the repo had no schema at all (the migration script
  assumed the tables existed). Idempotent.
- **docs(readme): rewrote the install guide** — a step-by-step **Local setup** (prerequisites,
  clone → run `schema.sql` → Supabase keys → Blob token → OAuth app → env → run) and added the
  missing **Supabase / `schema.sql`** step to both Vercel deploy paths (manual + AI agent).
- **docs(claude): added a "Working principles" section** (think-before-coding, simplicity,
  surgical changes, goal-driven verification) at the top of CLAUDE.md, adapted to this repo —
  notably that verification = `npm run build` + `npm run lint` (no test suite). Pure docs — no
  version bump.

## 2026-06-22 (auto-sized header logo)
- **feat(logo): the header logo is auto-compressed to the chosen size.** The owner's picked logo
  (`logoUrl`) is ALWAYS kept untouched; on every settings save we (re)build one small WebP scaled to
  the header width at **2x for retina** (`renderLogo` in `lib/files.ts`, via sharp, never upscaled
  past the source) and serve THAT in the header (`logoRenderUrl`). The previous derived file is
  deleted each regeneration, so exactly one ever lives on the store (under `files/logo-*.webp`, hidden
  from every grid). Regenerates only when the source or `logoWidth` changes (or none exists yet);
  cleared when the logo is removed/hidden. Vector (svg) / animated (gif) logos are served as-is (no
  derived file). Cuts the header image payload from the full-size original to a few KB — the main
  PageSpeed "image delivery" win.
- **fix(cls): the logo now reserves its space.** The `<img>` carries `width`+`height` (`logoRenderHeight`
  = displayed height at `logoWidth`), so the header no longer shifts as the logo loads. `v0.9.27`.

## 2026-06-22 (one-font rule — absolute, no exceptions)
- **change(typography): one typeface for EVERYTHING, hard rule.** Removed the last monospace
  spots in admin (hex inputs, raw-Markdown source editor, code-token button, activity badge) — the
  whole app, public and admin, now renders in the single site font (`--font-sans`); `grep font-mono
  src` is empty.
- **feat(og): the OG image follows the custom font too.** When the owner uploads a font, `lib/og.ts`
  appends `?font=<blobUrl>` and the `/og` route renders the card in it (Blob host only, SSRF-guarded;
  Inter stays the glyph fallback). With no custom font it stays Inter — so the share image always
  matches the site's one font.
- **docs:** recorded the rule (one font + zero hardcoded font/size, everywhere incl. admin + OG; a
  custom font governs the whole site) in CLAUDE.md conventions + the Typography/OG sections. `v0.9.26`.

## 2026-06-22 (type scale re-tuned + one font everywhere)
- **change(typography): smaller, calmer default scale.** List-card titles (H2) were reading as
  banners — the whole scale was re-tuned down to a restrained ~1.18 ratio off an 18px body:
  `h1 1.95 / h2 1.4 / h3 1.2 / h4 1.15 / h5 0.9 rem` (was `2.26 / 1.74 / 1.45 / 1.24 / 0.9`),
  with line-heights/letter-spacing balanced per role for long-form reading. Reset restores these.
- **change(typography): one typeface for everything.** Code blocks + inline code now reuse the
  site font (Inter or the uploaded face) instead of a separate monospace stack — no font family
  is ever auto-added on the reading site. (Admin keeps functional monospace for the hex inputs +
  raw-Markdown source editor, a deliberate tool affordance.)
- **chore(typography): full site sweep, no stray hardcoded sizes.** Search inputs now use the
  `.fs-h2`/`.fs-h3` roles; the only remaining fixed public sizes are the brand wordmark and the
  404 numeral (deliberate display). Admin's arbitrary `text-[10px]/[11px]` badges normalized to
  `text-xs`; admin chrome otherwise stays on Tailwind's standard scale by design (it must NOT
  resize when the owner tunes the reader's content sizes). `v0.9.25`.

## 2026-06-21 (full per-role typography + per-weight fonts)
- **feat(typography): every text role fully tunable, zero hardcoded sizes.** Nine roles —
  h1–h5, body, small (dates/meta/related/ToC/pagination/search), caption, code — each with its
  own **size / line-height / letter-spacing**, emitted as CSS vars (`--fs-*`, `--lh-*`, `--ls-*`).
  All public reading + secondary text now maps to a role (new `.t-small` utility replaced every
  `text-sm`); only brand wordmark, search box, and the 404 numeral stay as deliberate one-offs.
  Defaults are tuned to read well; reset restores them exactly.
- **feat(typography): custom font per weight.** Four upload slots (Regular 400 / Medium 500 /
  SemiBold 600 / Bold 700) sharing one family — one `@font-face` per weight, so headings/bold are
  crisp (the site disables faux-bold). `POST /api/files/font` takes a `weight`; `settings.customFont`
  is now `{ family, faces[] }`. Old single-file shape migrates to the 400 slot.
- **change(admin): Settings tabs finalized** — Appearance holds colors + font (4 slots) + the
  per-role text-size table; Advanced holds the font-smoothing toggle + custom CSS. `v0.9.24`.

## 2026-06-21 (fonts + typography controls + settings tabs)
- **feat(typography): custom font upload.** Admin → Settings → Appearance can upload a typeface
  (`.woff2/.woff/.ttf/.otf`); it's stored on Blob under `files/` (separate from the media grid),
  registered via `@font-face`, and applied site-wide (`--font-sans`, Inter stays the fallback).
  `POST /api/files/font` → `{ url, family }`; `settings.customFont`. Remove restores Inter.
- **feat(typography): body size + reading rhythm + smoothing.** The scale now also covers normal
  body text (`--fs-base`); new controls for **line spacing** (`--lh-body`), **letter spacing**
  (`--ls-body`), and a **font-smoothing (anti-alias)** toggle. Stored in `settings.typography`,
  injected as a `:root` override; each group has its own reset-to-default.
- **change(admin): Settings split into 3 tabs** — General, Appearance, Advanced. Colors + font +
  text sizes live under Appearance; spacing/smoothing + custom CSS under Advanced. `v0.9.23`.

## 2026-06-21 (typography follow-up)
- **change(typography): list cards use H2, not H1.** Single post/page titles (and category/tag
  list-page headings) stay H1; post titles inside listings step down to H2 so the listing reads
  calmer. `v0.9.22`.

## 2026-06-21 (typography scale)
- **feat(typography): one site-wide heading scale (H1–H5), no hardcoded sizes.** Heading
  sizes now flow from five CSS variables (`--fs-h1`…`--fs-h5`) instead of per-element
  `text-[…]` values. Defaults follow the owner's spec — H1 ≈ 30% larger than H2, H2 20%
  larger than before (and 20% larger than H3), H4 10% larger than body text, H5 20% smaller
  (body = 1.125rem): `2.26 / 1.74 / 1.45 / 1.24 / 0.9 rem`. **Every title** (single post,
  single page, list cards, category/tag list pages, draft preview) uses **H1**.
- **feat(editor): H4 + H5 buttons** in the post/page editor toolbar (alongside H1–H3); the
  public renderer + `.prose` now style `h4`/`h5`.
- **feat(settings): "Heading sizes" card** (Admin → Settings) to customize each level (rem)
  with a live preview and a **reset-to-default** button. Stored in `settings.typography`,
  injected as a `:root` override after `globals.css`. `v0.9.21`.

## 2026-06-21 (uploads)
- **fix(media/files): browser-direct uploads — large files no longer fail.** Images and
  attachments now upload straight from the browser to Vercel Blob (`/api/media/blob-token` +
  `/api/media/register`, `/api/files/blob-token` + `/api/files/register`), bypassing the
  serverless **4.5MB request-body limit** that was silently dropping bigger files. The metadata
  is registered server-side (dimensions + thumbnail fetched back for images), the new item
  appears in the grid/list immediately (no refresh), and success/failure is always reported.
  Removed the old `POST /api/media/upload` and `POST /api/files`. `v0.9.20`.

## 2026-06-21 (analytics follow-up)
- **feat(analytics): scroll-depth / average read %.** A `<ScrollDepth/>` beacon on posts sends
  the max % of the page reached on leave (`analytics_scroll` table); the dashboard shows an
  overall "avg. read depth" and a per-page % in Top pages. `v0.9.19`.
- **feat(analytics): 24-hour range (hourly buckets).** New 24h option before 7d; the chart
  buckets by hour for it (day otherwise), via a `bucket` arg on `analytics_summary`. `v0.9.19`.
- **feat(admin): View column on the content tables.** Posts and Pages now show all-time total
  views per item (`analytics_totals` RPC → `getViewTotals`). `v0.9.19`.
- **change(analytics): keep events forever.** Dropped the 1-year cron purge — the full history
  is retained. `v0.9.19`.
- **change(admin): Analytics moved next to the home tab** in the admin nav. `v0.9.19`.

## 2026-06-21 (admin + analytics batch)
- **feat(analytics): self-hosted, cookieless page-view analytics.** New Postgres
  `analytics_events` table + `analytics_summary` RPC, a fire-and-forget `<Track/>` beacon
  (`POST /api/track`, runs after the response, never makes a page dynamic), and an
  **Admin → Analytics** page: total views, unique visitors, a daily bar series, and top
  pages over 7d / 30d / 1y. Visitors are counted by a salted IP+user-agent hash — no
  cookies, no PII stored; bots and admin/api paths are dropped. The hourly cron purges
  events older than a year. `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(admin): multi-select delete in the library.** Checkboxes + "Delete selected" on
  both the Images grid and the Files list (atomic batch delete; new `deleteFilesBatch` +
  `POST /api/files/delete`). `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(admin): Files tab lists the site icons.** The favicon / app icon uploaded in
  Settings now appear in a read-only group (tagged "Settings", `getSiteIcons` +
  `GET /api/files/icons`). An intro under the Library title explains image versions vs
  files-as-is. `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(admin): richer System panel.** The Overview system card now shows the live URL,
  branch, framework + Node runtime, and deep-links to the Vercel dashboard, Blob stores,
  the Supabase project, and the GitHub commit. `v0.9.18`.
- **feat(public): search opens in an overlay.** The header search icon opens a modal
  search-in-place (instant local title/tag + debounced body FTS) instead of navigating to
  `/search` (which still exists for deep links / no-JS). New `GET /api/search/index` serves
  the lean index. `v0.9.18`.

## 2026-06-21 (later)
- **style(post): match the single-post title to the list card title.** The `/[slug]` post
  heading now uses the same size + weight as the home/list card title (`text-[1.35rem]
  font-semibold`) so a post reads consistently from the listing into the article. `v0.9.17`.

## 2026-06-21
- **perf(images): intrinsic width/height + eager LCP image.** Body images now render with their
  stored pixel dimensions (from the `media` table) so the browser reserves the box before bytes
  arrive — eliminates layout shift (CLS). The first body image loads eagerly with
  `fetchpriority=high` (likely the LCP element) instead of lazily. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(reading): server-side syntax highlighting (Shiki).** Code blocks are highlighted at
  render with Shiki (Vitesse light/dark, muted to fit the minimal surface) — zero client JS.
  Dual-theme tokens swap with the site's dark mode via CSS. Unknown languages / failures fall
  back to the plain escaped block. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(search): full-text search over the article body.** The public search now also queries
  the Postgres `search` tsvector (`/api/search`, `websearch_to_tsquery('simple')`) so matches
  inside post bodies surface, merged after the instant local title/tag results. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(admin): filter + status tabs on the posts table.** A folded title/tag search box and an
  All/Published/Draft segmented control to find posts fast as the archive grows. `v0.9.16`.
- **feat(reading): back-to-top button + wide-image mobile clamp.** A themed scroll-to-top button
  appears past the first viewport on posts; `img-wide` figures clamp to the column on phones so
  they never force horizontal scrolling. `v0.9.16`.

## 2026-06-22
- **fix(cache): tag Supabase reads + `revalidateTag('db')` on every save.** GET reads now carry
  the `db` tag (cache-eligible, so pages stay ISR); each write helper in `revalidate.ts` calls
  `revalidateTag('db','max')` alongside its `revalidatePath` superset, so a re-rendered page
  always reads fresh from Postgres — closes the window where an ISR page could serve up-to-1h
  stale data after an edit. `v0.9.15`.
- **feat(media): cron backfills missing thumbnails.** `finalizePendingThumbs` generates a
  `-thumb.webp` for any media row without a thumb (e.g. migration imports), so the library grid
  never has to load full-size originals. Runs hourly with the variant sweep. `v0.9.15`.
- **chore: code + docs cleanup after the Supabase move.** Removed the dead vanity-domain
  priming (`getSettings()` calls in read paths), tidied the data layer, and rewrote the caching
  / Blob / data-model docs (CLAUDE/ARCHITECTURE/README) to match the Postgres model; legacy
  `_index.json` scripts flagged as pre-migration. `v0.9.15`.
- **fix(media): render the canonical lowercase Blob host.** The store id is mixed-case in the
  token but the public host is lowercase; `blobBase()` now lowercases it so image URLs are
  canonical (avoids uppercase/lowercase duplicate-URL SEO). `v0.9.14`.
- **change(media): drop the vanity media domain — serve images straight from Vercel Blob.**
  Removed the `mediaBaseUrl` setting + `BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE` env + the `setMediaBase`/`publicBase`
  machinery; `expandBlob`/`blobOrigin` now always use the Blob store host. Fixes broken
  thumbnails in the media library (the proxy returned a restrictive CSP), simplifies the data
  layer (removed the now-dead `getSettings()` priming from every read), and keeps content
  store-relative so a future move (e.g. → R2) is still just a token/base swap. `v0.9.13`.
- **feat(seo): image sitemap + Article image.** `sitemap.xml` now lists each post's images
  (`<image:image>`) and the post's `BlogPosting` JSON-LD carries an `image` (featured, else the
  first body image), so search engines associate every image with its manhhung.me page even
  though the files are on the Blob host. New `extractImageUrls` helper. `v0.9.13`.
- **feat(admin): activity log — transparent record of admin actions.** Every mutation
  (post/page create·update·delete, media/file upload·delete, icon upload, settings save,
  taxonomy change, cache clear) is recorded to a Postgres `activity_log` table and shown on
  a new **Admin → Log** page (newest first, with a Clear button). Logging is toggleable in
  Settings → Features (`activityLog`, default on); writes happen via `after()` so they never
  slow the action. New `src/lib/activity.ts`, `GET/DELETE /api/activity`. `v0.9.12`.
- **feat(admin): System panel on the Overview.** Shows hosting (Vercel) + region + environment
  + commit, the database (Supabase · region · ref) with a live reachability check, and the
  media storage host. `v0.9.12`.
- **fix(media): deleting an image now removes EVERY version, original included.** Delete attempts
  the original + thumbnail + all four display variants for any raster (idempotent / no-op when a
  file is absent), regardless of the `variants` flag, so nothing is ever left orphaned on the
  store. Upload already keeps the untouched original. `v0.9.12`.
- **feat(storage): move all TEXT content from Vercel Blob to Supabase Postgres (P1.5).** Posts,
  pages, revisions, media/file metadata and settings now live in Postgres tables; the
  `_index.json` manifests + `.md` files are gone. Binaries (images, attachments, icons) stay on
  Vercel Blob, referenced store-relative (still portable, e.g. to Cloudflare R2). This kills the
  whole class of no-DB bugs at the root: **deleted images can no longer "come back"** (each row
  delete is atomic — no concurrent manifest read-modify-write to clobber), reads are always
  fresh + transactional (no `?ts` cache-bust needed; removed), and **admin save is faster** —
  the read-modify-write of the manifest is now a single atomic upsert. New `src/lib/db.ts`
  (server-only `service_role` client; reads cache-eligible for ISR, writes `no-store`).
  A Postgres `tsvector` column is in place for future body search. Schema lives in the
  `Quire Blog` Supabase project (ap-southeast-1). `v0.9.11`.
- **perf(save): display-variant (AVIF/WebP) encoding moved OFF the save request.** `savePost`/
  `savePage` return immediately after the DB write; `finalizeContentMedia` runs in the
  background via `after()` (the original always renders meanwhile). An hourly Vercel Cron
  (`/api/cron`) sweeps any still-pending variants AND keep-alives the Supabase free-tier
  project so it never pauses. `v0.9.11`.
- **fix(media): atomic batch delete — fixes "deleted unused images come back".** Root cause was
  a lost-update race, not matching: deleting several unused images fired separate requests that
  each read the same manifest and wrote their own copy, so the last write clobbered the earlier
  removals (a no-DB concurrency bug). New `deleteMediaBatch` removes ALL given URLs in ONE
  manifest read-modify-write (single delete now delegates to it), and a **"Delete all unused"**
  button (`POST /api/media/delete`) sweeps the whole unused set atomically. Blob-file cleanup is
  best-effort after the write and only touches variants that were actually generated (faster).
  `v0.9.10`.
- **fix(media): surface a silent no-match delete + add an owner diagnostic.** If the delete
  endpoint matched nothing (URL still present in the returned list), the library now shows an
  explicit error toast instead of leaving the image silently in place. Added owner-only
  `GET /api/media/debug?url=…` reporting the manifest size, the extracted match key, how many
  entries matched, a sample of stored URLs, and the configured media base — ground truth for a
  "stuck" delete. `v0.9.9`.
- **fix(media): delete now matches host-independently + writes manifest first.** Root-caused the
  "deleted image stays / re-appears in unused check" once more: the match relied on
  `collapseBlob` stripping the URL host, which silently found nothing if the primed host didn't
  equal the URL's host — so the manifest was never rewritten. Now `deleteMedia`/`deleteFile`
  match by the extracted `media/…` / `files/…` **pathname** (works for any host or a collapsed
  path, no `getSettings` priming needed), and write the reduced manifest **before** the blob-file
  cleanup so the removal sticks even if the (slower) file deletes stall. Dropped the per-delete
  settings read too (faster). `v0.9.8`.
- **style(theme): nicer public palette trigger icon** — replaced the swatch-grid glyph with
  three overlapping color circles (cleaner, clearly "color theme"). `v0.9.7`.
- **fix(media)/perf(admin): authoritative-from-write deletes (approach A).** The image/file
  delete endpoints now return the **true post-delete list, built from the in-memory manifest
  they just wrote — no Blob re-read** — and the library adopts it directly. This removes the
  read-after-write/eventual-consistency window that made a deleted image seem to "come back",
  and makes a failed server delete visible instead of silently optimistic. Hardened
  `deleteMedia`/`deleteFile`: only rewrite the manifest when an entry actually matched (never
  wipe it on a transient read failure), and sweep the original + thumb + all four display
  variants for any raster (regardless of the stored `variants` flag). `v0.9.6`.
- **chore: version in README title + repo link on the Overview pill.** The README H1 now
  carries the version (`# Quire Blog (v0.9.x)`, kept in sync on each bump), and the admin
  Overview version pill links to the repo root (`/quire`) instead of the releases page.
  `v0.9.5`.
- **feat(theme): polish the palette pickers + localize palette names.** Admin Settings →
  Appearance: the preset cards are more compact and spaced out, borderless — the selected
  palette reads via full opacity + a bold name while the rest sit dimmed (no rings/borders).
  Public switcher: a clearer swatch-grid trigger icon (the artist-palette glyph was ambiguous)
  and a wider preview chip that shows each palette's basic colors (heading/body/link/meta).
  Palette names (Mono/Sepia/Forest/Ocean/Rosé/Amber) are now **localized** via a `paletteNames`
  dict in all six admin + six public locales (no longer hardcoded in `themes.ts`).
- **chore(admin-nav): rename nav items.** "Pages / Posts" → **Content**; the appearance
  switcher now shows a fixed **"Appearance"** label instead of the current palette's name.
  Both across all six admin locales. `v0.9.4`.
- **feat(library): rename the media page to "Library" and split it into two tabs** — **Images**
  (the existing media library, unchanged) and **Files**, a new catch-all store for non-image
  attachments (PDF, zip, docx, audio…). Files upload to the `files/` Blob prefix with their own
  manifest (`files/_index.json`), with upload / copy-URL / download / delete; the site icons
  under `files/` (favicon, app icon) are excluded from the tab. New `GET/POST /api/files` +
  `DELETE /api/files/by`; nav label + page title updated across all six locales. `v0.9.3`.
- **fix(media): delete now removes ALL versions of an image from Blob and actually takes
  effect.** Two bugs in `deleteMedia`: (1) it didn't prime the vanity media base before
  `collapseBlob`, so when a custom media host was configured the deleted URL never collapsed to
  its `media/…` pathname — nothing matched and the delete silently no-op'd (the image stayed in
  the library, including "unused" items). (2) display variants (`-1024/-1600` AVIF+WebP) were
  only removed when the manifest `variants` flag was true, leaving orphans if it was stale. Now
  it primes settings first and unconditionally sweeps the thumb + all four variants for any
  raster original. `v0.9.2`.
- **docs(deploy): expanded the "Deploy to Vercel" guide into two clear methods** — (A) manual
  via the Vercel dashboard (fork → Blob store → env vars → OAuth callback → sign in), noting the
  two `vercel.json` settings to adjust for yourself (the `sin1` region is just the author's
  nearest region — change it; the 60s upload `maxDuration` can exceed the free plan); and (B) handing the whole
  install to an AI agent with Vercel + GitHub access (generic — OpenClaw / Hermes / Claude / …)
- **docs(license): make the code-vs-content split explicit.** The platform code stays
  **MIT** — free to use/modify/redistribute with **no attribution required**. Clarified that
  the blog **content** published with it (the author's writing/images, e.g. manhhung.me) is
  **© all rights reserved** and not covered by MIT. Added a "Scope" note to `LICENSE`, a
  two-layer README License section, `"license": "MIT"` in package.json, and an **MIT pill** on
  the admin Overview (links to the LICENSE) so the open-source status shows in-app too
- **chore(audit): add `audit/` log + repeatable audit procedure** (`audit/README.md`): an
  8-section pass (baseline → security → logic → perf → code quality → layout → i18n → docs)
  recorded as dated reports, so each comprehensive review starts from the last clean line.
  First report `audit/2026-06-22-comprehensive.md`. CLAUDE.md points to it; CHECKLIST gains a
  **Layout / visual** section (was missing despite the owner's alignment sensitivity)
- **fix(layout): de-duplicate the public header icon-button class into `ICON_BTN`**
  (`components/ui/iconButton.ts`). Search / palette / theme / menu each re-typed the same
  `h-10 w-10 … text-meta hover:bg-rule` string — a drift risk the "one shared class" rule
  forbids; now all four import the constant (same pattern as `ADMIN_NAV`)
- **chore: full project audit (tech / security / perf / logic) — clean.** No vulnerabilities or
  logic bugs found: every write/delete route is owner-gated, palette colors are hex-validated
  before the `<style>` emit, custom CSS strips `</style`, raw HTML in markdown is escaped,
  preview tokens use `timingSafeEqual`, RSS/sitemap output is escaped, icon upload is
  type+kind-whitelisted. Fixed stale docs/comments only: corrected the `themes.ts` header to the
  per-palette model, the CHECKLIST "Clean unused → Check unused" (read-only) line, README feature
  list (palettes/PWA/time-machine/icons) + Blob prefixes, and the ARCHITECTURE data model
  (`revisions/`, `files/`, per-palette settings) + theming/PWA design notes
- **feat(theme): visitor palette switcher (6 palettes) on public + admin headers** — like the
  dark/light toggle but for color palette. `PaletteToggle` writes `<html data-palette>` +
  localStorage; `themesToCss` emits every palette's vars so switching is instant (no reload), and
  a no-FOUC script applies the saved palette before paint. Mode (light/dark) × palette are now
  orthogonal axes
- **feat(settings): every palette is independently customizable** — admin color editor now edits
  ANY of the 6 palettes (picker = which one you're editing), each saved under `settings.themes`;
  "Set as default" picks the visitor default; per-mode reset restores that palette's built-in
  colors. Replaces the old single `theme` (auto-migrated into the default palette on read)
- **fix(settings): favicon / app icon upload moved out of the media library** to a dedicated
  `files/` store (`POST /api/files/upload`, `lib/files.ts`, `IconUpload`). **Accepts `.ico`** (the
  media library rejected it) plus PNG/SVG/JPG/WebP/GIF; site icons no longer clutter the grid

## 2026-06-21
- **feat(pwa): installable app on iPhone + Android** — add to the home screen and launch
  standalone (full-screen, no browser chrome). Dynamic `app/manifest.ts` (name/theme/icon from
  settings) + apple-touch-icon + `appleWebApp` + per-mode `theme-color` (`generateViewport`).
  New **App icon** picker in Settings (next to the favicon); icon resolves appIcon → favicon →
  bundled `public/app-icon.png`. **Installable + standalone only — no service worker / no
  offline** (kept thin on purpose; admin & API are never cached). `resolveAppIcon` in settings.ts
- **feat(settings): 6 built-in color presets** (Mono / Sepia / Forest / Ocean / Rosé / Amber),
  each a full light+dark palette tuned for readable contrast in both modes (`lib/themes.ts`).
  Appearance now opens with a palette picker (live light/dark preview swatches); selecting one
  fills both modes, and `settings.themePreset` remembers the choice so each mode's "reset"
  restores THAT preset's colors. Every color stays fully editable + savable after picking;
  the public site still renders only `theme` via `themeToCss`, so nothing is hardcoded
- **change(media): replaced the destructive "Clean unused" button with a read-only "Check
  unused" audit** (`GET /api/media/unused`, `lib/media-usage.ts`; removed `lib/sweep.ts` +
  `POST /api/media/sweep`). It badges media referenced by no post/page/settings in the grid
  and offers a "show unused only" filter — the owner deletes by hand. Now also scans **revision
  snapshots**, so an image kept only in the time machine is no longer flagged (the old sweeper
  ignored revisions and could permanently delete an image a restore still needed)
- **fix(admin): header wordmark/menu now share one h-9 box → perfectly aligned.** Removed the
  `v0.x.y` badge from beside the logo; the running version (now a link to GitHub releases)
  lives only on the Overview page. Alignment rule documented in CLAUDE.md (no more baseline drift)
- **feat(admin): media library shows each image's resolution** (`w×h`). Uploads now capture
  dimensions for svg/gif/webp too (not just jpg/png); `backfill-media-dimensions.mjs` filled the
  existing library (45 images)
- docs: corrected the changelog dates — entries had drifted into the future (up to 06-25);
  remapped to the real git timeline (work happened 06-19 → 06-21 only)
- **docs: added `ROADMAP.md`** (Vercel-or-Docker from one codebase, publishing from Markdown
  note apps, optional AI assist) and refreshed the guidance files for self-hosters: README
  stack/versions + Node 20.9+ requirement + roadmap pointer, and corrected the stale
  "full purge on every save" wording in README/ARCHITECTURE to the current scoped
  invalidation (`src/lib/revalidate.ts`). Added an `engines.node` field to `package.json`.

- **feat(admin): manage categories & tags (new Phân loại tab).** A third tab on the content
  dashboard lists every category and tag with its usage count and lets you **rename** (merges
  into an existing term) or **remove** it across ALL posts in one action (`updateTerm` →
  `POST /api/taxonomy`, owner-only; rewrites each affected `.md` + the index, then full purge)
- **feat(admin): open-in-new-tab row action.** Each published post/page row gets an
  open-in-new-tab icon (left of edit) → its public URL; drafts omit it (would 404)
- **fix(admin): mobile-friendly content tables.** Secondary columns now hide on small screens
  (posts: date `sm`, categories `md`; pages: slug `sm`) so Title + Status + actions always fit
  and the status pill never wraps awkwardly. The tab + new-post row wraps on mobile too
- **fix(admin): header alignment + bigger logo.** The `Quire Blog` wordmark, its `v0.x.y` badge
  and the menu now share one vertically-centred line (was baseline-misaligned)
- **fix(admin): header polish.** Wordmark enlarged to logo size (`text-xl`); the version
  (`v0.7.5`) sits next to it and links to GitHub releases (replaces the removed footer link).
  Every header item now shares a fixed-height (`h-9`) `ADMIN_NAV` box so the row stays
  perfectly aligned on one line (fixes the recurring "menu not lined up" drift)
- **feat(admin): cleaner, responsive header + no footer.** The admin top bar is now one
  uniform row of text links: a `Quire Blog` wordmark (bold `blog`) replaces the old bold
  "Quản trị" brand; the first nav link is now **Trang chủ** (was "Quản trị"). The three
  right-side controls (theme, clear-cache, sign-out) are styled as the SAME text links as the
  menu — no longer button-shaped — and the theme control shows the applied theme as a **word**
  instead of a sun/moon icon. On mobile the whole menu collapses behind a **hamburger** toggle
  instead of spilling inline. Removed the `Quire Blog vX · changelog` admin footer. New
  `AdminHeader` client component; `ADMIN_NAV` shared style; `ThemeToggle` gains `variant='text'`;
  `CacheButton` gains a `className`. Locale key `navAdmin` → `navHome` (all 6 languages)
- **feat(seo): richer robots.txt policy.** Replaces the bare allow-all with three groups:
  major search engines + reputable AI assistants (Googlebot/Bingbot…, GPTBot/ClaudeBot/
  PerplexityBot/Google-Extended…, paired with `/llms.txt`) are explicitly allowed; aggressive
  SEO/data scrapers (`BAD_BOTS`: AhrefsBot, SemrushBot, MJ12bot, DotBot, PetalBot, Bytespider…)
  get `Disallow: /` to save crawl budget/bandwidth; `*` stays welcoming so unknown good bots
  (incl. new AI crawlers) keep working. Bot lists are editable consts atop `app/robots.ts`.
  Still gated by `seo.robots`; `/admin` + `/api` always off-limits
- **docs(claude): document media portability / no vendor lock-in.** New "Portability"
  section in CLAUDE.md: content is stored vendor-host-free (store-relative refs), the vanity
  domain already fronts media, Vercel coupling is isolated to `src/lib/blob.ts`, and a
  step-by-step path to migrate to an S3-compatible store (e.g. Cloudflare R2) without
  rewriting content or breaking public URLs
- chore(release): pre-release audit — `build`, `lint`, `tsc` all clean; verified every
  write/delete API route is owner-gated; removed an unused var in `remap-original-images.mjs`

## 2026-06-20
- **feat(seo): dynamic OG cards for the home, category and tag pages** (same card as
  posts/pages). Home: top line = domain, bottom = site description. Category: top line = the
  name; tag: top line = `#name` (the # marks it as a tag); both bottom = domain. Honors the
  dynamic-OG toggle + fallback image like the rest;
  new `ogCardUrl`/`siteDomain` helpers in `lib/og.ts`. The OG `site` line is now length-capped
- **fix(blog): desktop table-of-contents pinned to the viewport's left edge (50px in).**
  It was absolutely positioned against the centered content column's left edge, so wide /
  full-bleed images broke out into the gutter and overlapped it. Now `fixed` to the viewport,
  vertically centred (clears header/footer), with a max-height scroll for long lists
- **fix(admin): even header action cluster.** The "Clear cache" button was missing `text-sm`
  (oversized text) and changed width while busy (the `…` suffix), making it look lopsided next
  to the nav. Clear-cache + sign-out now share one `HEADER_ACTION` class constant
  (`components/admin/headerActions.ts`) so they can't drift again; busy state is shown by
  dimming, not a width-changing label. Convention added to CLAUDE.md
- **refactor(cache): all invalidation centralized in `src/lib/revalidate.ts` + scoped purges.**
  Edits now apply reliably and without dumping the whole site each time: a new post refreshes
  only the list/taxonomy surfaces (home, pagination, every category/tag page, feed/sitemap/llms)
  and leaves other post bodies warm; editing/deleting a post also refreshes its own page;
  editing a static page touches just its URL + sitemap; settings still purge the whole site and
  now re-warm it. Each helper is a deliberate SUPERSET of affected surfaces, so a change is
  never under-purged (the old "applies late" bug). One accepted minor staleness: the related-
  posts box on other posts (self-heals ≤1h, or use "Clear all cache")
- **fix(admin): editor save now calls `router.refresh()`** (PostForm + PageForm, matching
  SettingsView) so the client Router Cache is dropped — saves show on the next navigation
  instead of lagging behind a stale RSC. Pairs with the `staleTimes` config fix below
- **feat(security): baseline security response headers on every route** (`next.config.ts`
  `headers()`): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy:
  strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy` (camera/mic/geo/topics off). HSTS is
  already added by Vercel. CSP deliberately deferred (needs nonces + Report-Only rollout for
  the inline theme script + Analytics + OG + Blob images)
- fix(config): `experimental.staleTimes.static` was set to `0`, which Next 16 rejects (min 30)
  and silently ignored — leaving static routes on the ~5min client-cache default. Set to `30`
  (lowest accepted), so soft-nav freshness now matches the documented intent
- **refactor(cache): ISR pages + full purge on save (replaces the earlier force-dynamic).**
  Public pages are ISR-cached again for speed (`revalidate = 3600`; `/[slug]` prerendered via
  `generateStaticParams`), but every admin write now calls a single `revalidatePath('/',
  'layout')` that purges the WHOLE site — so an edit (content, theme/background, anything) is
  live on the next request. Reliable this time because it's ONE cache layer (no
  `unstable_cache`), the Full Route Cache is per-deployment (no cross-deploy stale), and Blob
  reads are `?ts`-busted (fresh on every regeneration). `blob.ts` reads switched from
  `cache: 'no-store'` to `{ next: { revalidate } }` so pages can be ISR-cached
- fix(settings): changing site settings (e.g. background color) now applies immediately —
  the save purges the cached layout/theme site-wide
- feat(admin): "Clear all cache" button is back and actually works — purges everything
  (`revalidatePath('/', 'layout')`) then warms the home + newest detail pages (`/api/cache/clear`)
- admin is fully `force-dynamic` (uncached) so the editor/media/settings always reflect the
  current Blob state; client Router Cache fully off (`staleTimes { dynamic: 0, static: 0 }`)

- **refactor(cache): removed the data cache entirely — content is now always fresh.**
  `unstable_cache` + tag revalidation kept fighting Blob's read-after-write and serving
  stale content (new posts missing, **deleted media reappearing**, settings not applying,
  cross-deploy Data Cache persistence). Replaced with: reads use `React.cache()` only
  (request-scoped dedup), and every public page + SEO route is `force-dynamic`. An edit
  now shows on the next plain reload — no rebuild, no "Clear cache" step
- removed the admin "Clear cache" button and `/api/cache/clear` (no cache to clear); the
  `/[slug]` page is no longer SSG (`generateStaticParams` dropped) — it renders fresh;
  dropped all cache-key versioning. Blob store confirmed in Singapore beside the functions
- fix(media): deleting an image in the library now sticks (it was the data cache re-serving
  the old manifest after the delete) — addressed by the always-fresh reads above

- fix(media): inserted images that didn't show. A `<picture>` gives NO fallback when a
  chosen `<source>` 404s, but `PostContent` emitted AVIF/WebP sources for every jpg/png
  *by convention* — so any image whose deferred variants weren't generated rendered blank.
  Now `<picture>` is emitted ONLY for originals whose variants are confirmed (media index
  `variants:true`, passed to `PostContent`); everything else is a plain `<img>` of the
  original, which always loads. Save routes also `revalidateTag('media')` so the
  optimized `<picture>` appears once variants exist. Existing broken posts self-heal
- fix(type): body text now renders at full weight — removed `-webkit-font-smoothing:
  antialiased` (body + the `<html>` `antialiased` class) which thinned glyphs and made
  reading look lighter than the old blog; dropped the negative body `letter-spacing`
  (-0.011em) that cramped accented Vietnamese. Font stays Inter; heading tracking kept
- fix(media): uploads were intermittently failing. Root causes
  fixed: (1) the whole multi-file upload now does ONE read-modify-write of the manifest
  (`addMediaBatch`) instead of one per file, removing the lost-update race that dropped
  entries; (2) collision naming (`logo` → `logo-2`) now checks the ACTUAL store
  (`listBlobs`) ∪ manifest, so a stale manifest read can't pick a name that already
  exists; (3) `uploadFile` sets `allowOverwrite` as a final safety net so a re-upload
  never hard-throws "blob already exists"
- fix(editor): dragging an image into the editor now inserts reliably — the drop handler
  read a stale (null) editor from its capture closure; it now uses a live `editorRef`.
  Multiple dropped images upload sequentially and insert in order
- feat(seo): pagination is now path-based — `/page/2`, `/category/x/page/2`,
  `/tag/x/page/2` (was `?page=2`). Page 1 stays at the bare path; out-of-range or `/page/1`
  → 404 (no duplicate-content URLs). New `parsePathPage`; shared `BlogListing` component
- feat(read): blog list now shows reading time per post (gated by the readingTime
  feature). `readingMinutes` is computed from the body at save and stored in the index;
  `backfill-reading-time.mjs` filled it for existing posts. Index cache key → `v3`
- fix(ui): single post/page title now uses the same type scale as the blog-list title
  (one title format)

- feat(media): defer heavy variant encoding to save-time — drop/upload stores only the original + thumbnail (`variants:false`); the AVIF/WebP @1024/1600 set is generated by `finalizeContentMedia` on post/page save, only for images kept in the content (an image dropped then discarded never pays the AVIF encode). Save routes get `maxDuration=60`
- feat(media): "Clean unused" library button (`POST /api/media/sweep`, `lib/sweep.ts`) deletes media referenced by no post/page/settings — clears orphans
- feat(media): responsive image pipeline — jpg/png keep the **untouched original** + auto-generate `-1024`/`-1600` in **AVIF + WebP** + a `-thumb.webp`; `PostContent` renders `<picture>` so the browser auto-picks the lightest format/size. Library shows resolution + "download original"; delete removes all variants. svg/gif/webp stored as-is. HEIC dropped. Upload route `maxDuration=60`
- migration(blob): moved store to Singapore (`sin1`) — copied all blobs, collapsed stored URLs to pathnames, swapped `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (all envs), bumped cache keys for a clean cutover; media refs now store-relative end to end
- refactor(blob): store image refs **store-relative** (pathnames, not absolute URLs). `collapseBlob` on write / `expandBlob` on read in the data layer (posts/pages/settings); UI unchanged. Removes storeId lock-in — switching Blob store/region/provider needs no content rewrite. Idempotent, backward-compatible (old absolute URLs self-heal on next save)
- perf(region): `vercel.json` pins functions to `sin1` (Singapore) — was running in `iad1` (US-East), ~200ms from Vietnam; Singapore is ~40ms (Blob store also moved to Singapore, see above)

- feat(i18n): 4 new UI languages — German, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean (now en/vi/de/ja/zh/ko); **English is the default**
- refactor(i18n): strings moved to `src/locales/{<code>,admin/<code>}.ts`; `langs.ts` is the single source of truth (`SITE_LANGS` + `isSiteLang`); `satisfies` enforces every key in every language; `formatDate` is now Intl-per-locale (vi keeps custom form); language picker wraps
- fix(admin): language switch is now instant (optimistic `I18nProvider` state), no longer waits for the save round-trip
- fix(i18n): localize ~32 strings that were hardcoded Vietnamese (settings cards, reader-feature toggles, SEO fields, time machine, editor toasts) — they now translate in all 6 languages
- feat(admin): "Clear cache" button in the header (purges every data-cache tag + reloads) for an immediate "see my changes now" escape hatch

- feat(admin): clearer theme colour picker. The native `<input type="color">` swatch was tiny
  with default chrome, so it didn't read as clickable — enlarged it and stripped the inner
  padding/border so it's one clean colour chip. Clicking it opens the browser's full picker
  (2D area + hue + HEX); the hex field is now monospace/uppercase alongside.
- refactor(theme): every public-UI colour now comes from the theme tokens — no hardcoded
  `neutral-*`/`white`/`black`. Exposed `--c-*` as Tailwind utilities (`bg-bg`, `text-text`,
  `text-heading`, `text-meta`, `text-link`, `border-rule`) via `@theme inline`. **All lines +
  faint surfaces (TOC border, dropdowns, header/footer, code blocks, hovers, preview banner) use
  `--c-rule`**, so one colour in Admin → Giao diện drives them. Also fixes a dark-mode bug where
  code blocks stayed light (hardcoded `#f4f4f2` had no dark override).
- fix(editor): over-spaced bullet/numbered list items. TipTap wraps each item's content in a
  `<p>`, which inherited the 1.4em paragraph margin — items now sit tight + even (only genuine
  multi-paragraph items keep spacing). Shared `.prose` rule, so the editor matches the render.
- feat(editor): rounded out the toolbar to match standard markdown editors — **numbered list**,
  **task list** (GFM `- [ ]`, renders as checkboxes), **inline code**, **horizontal rule**, and
  **insert table** (the Table extension had no way to create one from the UI). Added the TipTap
  **Placeholder** extension so the empty-state hint actually shows (the old root `data-placeholder`
  rendered nothing). New deps: `@tiptap/extension-task-list`, `-task-item`, `-placeholder`.

- feat(admin): **Media domain (CDN)** field in Settings → SEO (`mediaBaseUrl`) — set a vanity
  host for public media URLs from the UI instead of an env var. Owner setting wins, falls back
  to `BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE`; pushed into the Blob layer via `setMediaBase()` on each settings read.
  New admin i18n keys `mediaDomain`/`mediaDomainHint` (all 6 locales). Data-layer reads
  (`posts`/`pages`/`media`) now prime `getSettings()` before `expandBlob`, so the field alone
  drives media URLs reliably (no cold-start ordering race) — the env var is no longer required
- fix(header): render the logo with a plain `<img>` instead of `next/image`. The optimizer
  only allows hosts whitelisted in `next.config` at build time, so a runtime-configurable media
  domain (Settings → Media domain / a Cloudflare Worker) made the optimized logo 404. A plain
  tag loads from whatever host the setting yields — no build coupling, no env, never breaks on a
  domain change. Logos are small + CDN-cached, so the lost optimization is negligible
- feat(seo): `/sitemaps.xml` 308-redirects to `/sitemap.xml` (alias for the plural form / old
  search-console submissions; no second sitemap to keep in sync)
- feat(media): optional vanity domain for public media URLs via `BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE` (e.g. a
  Cloudflare Worker on `files.<domain>` proxying the Blob store). `publicBase()` rewrites only
  rendered media URLs (`expandBlob` + `blobOrigin` preconnect); internal data reads stay on the
  store host (no proxy hop, `?ts` cache-bust intact). `collapseBlob` also strips the vanity host
- fix(content): restored 41 broken post images across 19 imported posts. A prior media wipe
  (removed small/resized versions) left these `media/...` refs 404ing. Re-fetched the ORIGINAL
  full-size files from the source WordPress site via the Rocket.net file API (the public domain
  is behind a Cloudflare challenge that blocks direct fetch), stripping WP `-WxH` resize
  suffixes; uploaded to Blob, rewrote the markdown, rebuilt `media/_index.json`. New scripts:
  `check-image-links.mjs` (audit), `remap-original-images.mjs` (recover + remap)
- feat(seo): SEO tab — JSON-LD schema, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, RSS `feed.xml`, dynamic OG image (`/og`, edge runtime), canonical `siteUrl`; all toggleable
- feat(read): client-side `/search` (lean pre-folded index), table of contents (desktop, sticky), reading-progress bar, related posts, reading time
- feat(admin): `Tính năng` tab — toggle reader features (search/toc/related/readingTime/progressBar); `Link nháp` HMAC draft-preview links (`/preview/[slug]`)
- feat: `@vercel/analytics`; themed `(blog)/not-found.tsx`
- perf: every Blob read wrapped in `unstable_cache` (tags posts/pages/media/settings) → `/[slug]` is now real SSG; `staleTimes { dynamic: 0, static: 180 }`; logo via `next/image`; modern `browserslist` drops legacy-JS polyfills; editor serialization debounced
- fix: public reads degrade to fallback instead of 500; bump `getSettings` cache key (Data Cache persists across deploys)
- refactor(dry): consolidate 3 toggle components into `ui/Switch.tsx`; one `<hr>` divider standard (50% left); no all-caps; drop dead classes
- docs: add `ARCHITECTURE.md`; refresh README caching/usage
- perf: replace `resolveUrl` (`list()` API call) with direct `blobUrl()` — halves Blob read latency
- perf: `getPublicPosts`, `getSettings`, `getPublicPages` cached via `unstable_cache` — cross-request cache with tag-based invalidation
- perf: `getPost` / `getPage` wrapped with `React.cache()` — deduplicates generateMetadata + page render calls
- perf: `[slug]/page.tsx` — `generateStaticParams` + `dynamicParams = true` for ISR (falls back to dynamic due to `revalidate: 0` Blob fetches, but structure is correct)
- perf: all admin write routes call `revalidateTag` / `revalidatePath` after save/delete
- fix: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` regex corrected to `vercel_blob_rw_` (was `vercelblob_rw_`)
- feat: `next.config.ts` — added Vercel Blob image remote patterns
- docs: CLAUDE.md expanded with Blob access, caching model, ISR, data layer reference, scripts
