// THIS FILE IS THE MACHINERY. The words are in `seed-content*.ts`, the threads in
// `seed-comments.ts`, the owner-facing half in `seed-admin.ts`, the history in
// `seed-activity.ts`, the library plates in `seed-media.ts`. The split is by AUDIENCE rather
// than by size: what a reader sees, what the owner sees, and the code that assembles both.
//
// `seed-demo.ts` stays: it exercises every island on one post, which is a different job from
// looking like a blog.
