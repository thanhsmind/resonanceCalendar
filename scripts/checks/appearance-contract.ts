// Guard #9: the promise custom CSS is written against still describes the software.
//
// This product ships no themes, so when the 155 knobs run out the answer is the owner's own
// stylesheet — and `docs/appearance.md` promises them a set of variable names and class names
// that "will not be renamed without a note in the changelog". Until 2026-08-31 nothing read
// that list. Renaming a variable or a class would have broken every custom stylesheet in the
// wild, silently, on somebody else's blog, with eight guards and 2448 tests all green.
//
// Three ways it can rot, and all three fail here:
//
//   1. A promised name DISAPPEARS from the code. The contract is now a lie.
//   2. The doc and `src/content/appearance-contract.ts` DRIFT. Whichever a reader trusts,
//      one of them is wrong — and the doc is the one users read, so both directions matter.
//   3. The list goes EMPTY, or the files move. Then this check passes vacuously, which is
//      how `check:css-literal` went quietly dead twice (see its header). Counted and
//      asserted, not assumed.

// page), Appearance → Type (Font, or Text sizes), Appearance → Colour, Appearance → Images,
