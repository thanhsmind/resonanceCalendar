// — a settings field two pixels taller than the button beside it does not fail a type check
// and does not fail a test. Four primary buttons, three tab tracks, two form controls and two
// stat tiles were all found by photographing the running admin, which is not a thing anyone
// does on every commit.

// So the signatures are checked here instead. Each one is a string that appears in exactly
// one primitive and has no reason to appear anywhere else. Adding a variant to a primitive is
// fine; re-typing its class list into a screen is what this stops.
