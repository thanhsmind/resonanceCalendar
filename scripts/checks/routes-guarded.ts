// Invariant 4, enforced: every write route is mounted on the owner-gated router group.
//
// `web/guard.ts` makes the gate structural — a route on an `ownerRouter()` is protected
// because of where it lives. This check is the other half: it makes mounting a write route
// somewhere ELSE a build failure rather than a thing to notice in review.
//
// The frozen tree had the same check for the same reason, and it earned its place: a
// per-handler `requireOwner()` is a line, and a line can be left out.
