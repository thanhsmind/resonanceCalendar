// got through. Then `prose.css.ts` was split out carrying the warning "NO BACKTICKS anywhere
// below: check:css-literal enforces that" in its own header and was never added here, so the
// fifth got through on 2026-07-29 while the check reported ok and the server refused to boot.
// Then `front.css.ts` and `utility.css.ts` shipped unlisted, and the sixth was caught by the
// type checker instead — the guard reported "ok (6 sheets)" against a file it had never read.
