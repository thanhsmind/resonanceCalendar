// Every size on the reader's page comes from a type ROLE, so the owner's typography settings
// actually control the page.
//
// The rule was written at the top of `public.css.ts` from the beginning, and by the time
// anyone measured, the islands sheet carried nine literals, a related-post title had no size
// rule at all, and the comment thread was a role the settings could not reach. A rule that
// only exists in a comment is a rule that has already been broken.
//
// Compliant: `var(--fs-<role>)`; `inherit`; a value in `em` (an ornament measured against its
// OWN context — a drop cap, a dinkus — which stays right at every role size); or a listed
// exception below, with a reason.
//
// ⚠️ The sheets are DISCOVERED, not listed, for the same reason `check:css-literal`'s are: a
// hand-kept list goes stale in the commit that adds a file, and a guard reading six of eight
// sheets still prints a tick. `mobile.css.ts` was never in the list and nobody noticed.
//
// `login.css.ts` is the one real exclusion: the sign-in page renders with an empty base sheet,
// so no `--fs-*` is defined and a role reference would resolve to nothing.
