// Guards the documentation layout, so the "four homes" rule is held by a red check rather
// than by prose nobody re-reads. See docs/README.md for the layout itself, and ADR 0010
// for why it exists.
//
// Seven rules, because the messes they catch are the ones this repository actually had:
//   1. No broken relative link between markdown files. Moving a doc used to leave dangling
//      links in five other files and nothing noticed. That is precisely what the reshuffle
//      that produced this file did to forty of them.
//   2. Every ADR appears in the decisions index, and the index cites no missing ADR.
//      An ADR nobody can find is worse than no ADR.
//   3. CLAUDE.md stays under its cap. It loads every turn, so it is a router, not a
//      library; it was 275 lines of restated rules before this check existed.
//   4. Nothing in docs/ carries a date in its filename. A dated file is a snapshot, and
//      snapshots left this repository with `state/` (ADR 0017).
//   5. No markdown file over 400 lines, CHANGELOG excepted (append-only by design).
//   6. A repository path written as code in a LIVE document exists. Rule 1 only sees links
//      between markdown files, so CLAUDE.md's debug router spent months pointing at two
//      source files that were not there, and the self-hosting guide documented a migration
//      command deleted a release earlier. Both were found by reading, not by a check.
//   7. The version, everywhere it is written down, is the one in package.json.
//   8. Every ADR header is the same three lines, and no proposal is left standing. Rule 2
//      checks that an ADR is FINDABLE; nothing checked that its status was true. ADR 0001
//      said "in force" for seven weeks after the cutover that ended it, and 0052 said
//      "proposed" while it was already running in production.
