// The settings screen's own flows, for the server-drawn version (ADR 0054).
//
// ⚠️ THIS SCREEN DRIVES THE MOST DANGEROUS ROUTES IN THE ADMIN, and not one of them is pressed
// here. The password, the recovery codes, the second factor, signing devices out, the SMTP test
// send, the provider's model list, the alt-text sweep, taking or deleting a backup, the off-site
// probe, a CDN purge, every import, minting or revoking an MCP token, deleting a redirect: all
// off limits. What IS driven is the screen — the strip, the search, the explanations, the
// controls that only move the FORM — plus `PUT /api/settings`, which the existing settings flows
// already exercise and which is restored afterwards.
//
// The Content API flow at the foot is the one that presses a Save in anger, and it is here for a
// reason nothing smaller can cover: the chain from a switch on this screen to a public endpoint
// answering runs through the form collector, a dotted path, `PUT /api/settings`, `sanitizeApi`
// and `apiRoute`, and every link of it has a unit test while the CHAIN has none. Two bugs of
// exactly that shape shipped on 2026-09-19 — a control that saved nothing, and a save that left
// a field out — and both were found by a browser flow after 3,800 unit tests had gone green.
