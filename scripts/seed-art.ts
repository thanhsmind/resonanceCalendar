// Twelve public-domain artworks for the media library, committed rather than drawn.
//
// The plates in `seed-media.ts` are geometry because sharp cannot be trusted with `<text>` on
// the demo box. These are photographs of real pages and real paint, committed as JPEG under
// `scripts/art/` and uploaded through the same path an author's own photo takes. Downloading
// them at seed time was rejected for the same reason the plates are drawn: `refresh.sh` runs
// on a 1 GB server whose network is not part of the contract, and a reseed that needs
// Wikimedia to be up is a reseed that will one day wipe the library and refill half of it.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY WORK IS OUT OF COPYRIGHT, and that is a constraint. Van Gogh died in 1890, Hokusai
// in 1849, the Kells folio is twelve centuries old; the reproductions are flat scans of
// two-dimensional pages, which acquire no new rights. A Picasso — rights running to 2044 in
// most of the world — cannot be in this list, however famous.
//
// ON SUBJECT, still: the fixture's rule is letterforms and the making of pages, and each earns
// its place under it — the reed pen, the woodblock press run, the half-uncial hand, and the
// page where printing begins.
//
// DETERMINISTIC NAMES, AND DELETED FIRST — same contract as `seed-media.ts`, for the same two
// reasons: the blob store outlives the database across reseeds, and the demo's two instances
// share one store.
