// yet", an empty redirects table, no revisions panel at all, and no post waiting for the
// scheduled-publishing headline feature.
//
// An empty screen is not a screenshot of a feature, it is a screenshot of its absence. So each
// block fills one screen through the SAME function the admin calls, never by writing a row: a
// fixture built on hand-made rows stops matching the product the first time a write path
// changes shape.
//
// The two exceptions are timestamps — `created_at` on a subscriber and `sent_at` on a newsletter
// row are stamped from the clock by design, and a mailing list where forty addresses arrived in
// one second is the detail that gives a fixture away. Those are written afterwards, and only
// those.
//
// The Log screen is the one owner-facing surface NOT filled from here: it is a hand-written
// timeline rather than a by-product of writing rows, so it lives in `seed-activity.ts`.

## The standard set

\`fi\`, \`fl\`, \`ff\`, \`ffi\`, \`ffl\`. On a face with a short f these are unnecessary and switching them off changes nothing visible.

## Discretionary is a different argument

TODO — the **st** and **ct** ligatures, and why a body text setting is the wrong place for them. Need to check what Literata actually ships before claiming anything here.

Hanging punctuation pushes the mark out into the margin so the LETTERS line up rather than the characters. Gutenberg's compositors did it by hand, and it is the single cheapest improvement available to a page of quoted text.

## The CSS is one property and it is not everywhere

\`hanging-punctuation: first last\` does the whole job in Safari and nothing at all in Chrome or Firefox at the time of writing, which is why almost no page on the web has it.

The fallback is a negative text-indent on the offending element, applied by hand. It is not worth doing for body text and it is very much worth doing for a pull quote, because a pull quote is large enough that the dent is obvious.

## The other half of the rule

The same applies to the right edge in justified text, and to hyphens at a line break. Both hang. Both are off by default. Both are invisible until someone shows you, and permanently visible afterwards.`,

*The Elements of Typographic Style*, Robert Bringhurst. Read the chapter on the measure, then stop and set something, then read the rest.

## Then the two about printing

*An Introduction to Bookbinding*, and any decent trade guide to imposition. Neither is about type at all, and between them they explain more about why books look the way they do than the type books manage.

## And two to argue with

*The Crystal Goblet*, Beatrice Warde — the case for invisible typography, made better than anyone has made it since, and wrong in interesting ways.

Because they are the same subject. A serif is a record of a pen; a margin is a record of a fold; a type scale is a record of somebody deciding what a page is for. Follow any of them far enough and you arrive at the other two.

## What runs it

[Quire Ink](https://github.com/joiha-steven/quireink), which is one process and two SQLite files. There is no database server, no build step and no deploy: the words go in through the admin and out as finished HTML.

The reading page is the product here, so every size, colour and space on it is a setting rather than a line of code.`,

The measure, the type scale, optical size, the golden canon. What a subsetter removes, and why the em dash is not the en dash.

## Calligraphy

The broad-edged pen, chancery italic, uncials, and how a page is ruled before anything is written on it.

## Printing

Imposition, registration, trapping, paper weights, and the vocabulary the bindery still uses.

Two series run across those: **Designing a reading page** in four parts, and **Ink and press** in three.`,
