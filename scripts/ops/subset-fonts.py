"""Rebuild the self-hosted webfont subsets in src/assets/static/fonts/.

THIS FILE IS THE THING docs/performance.md USED TO CITE AND NOT HAVE. That doc told you to
"run scripts/subset-font-axes.py after replacing any font file" against a path that has
never existed in this tree, so the one operation nobody could reproduce was the one the
whole font budget rests on. This is that script, written back, and it does more than the
axis trimming the old name implied.

    pip install fonttools brotli zopfli
    python3 scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py --check      # report, write nothing
    python3 scripts/ops/subset-fonts.py --write      # rebuild the files

Sources are downloaded from upstream on each run and cached under .tmp/. They are not
committed: they are 1-2 MB each, they are only needed when a face is rebuilt, and pinning
a copy in the repository is how the shipped subsets drifted from upstream in the first
place.

WHAT THIS DOES, AND WHY EACH PART IS HERE

  Axes.     opsz is PINNED to 18 and wght is CLAMPED to 400-700 (ADR 0009). The optical
            size axis stores a delta per glyph across its whole range and doubled both book
            serifs; 18 is the reading size this site sets. Pinning it is the single largest
            saving in the pipeline and it is not free -- a 32px heading now draws outlines
            drawn for 18px. That trade is the ADR's, recorded there.

  Features. The DEFAULT pyftsubset feature set, plus or minus a named few. Passing an
            explicit list instead is a trap that cost a whole debugging pass here: an
            explicit --layout-features drops every feature not named, and kern/mark/mkmk
            live in GPOS, so a subset built that way loses ALL KERNING. It looks like a 26%
            saving and it is a broken font. GPOS is asserted below for exactly that reason.

  onum.     Restored to the two book serifs. islands.css.ts asks book mode for
            font-feature-settings:"onum" 1,"dlig" 1 -- and no shipped face carried either,
            so the one typographic flourish book mode advertises had never rendered once.
            It costs about 2.8 KB on literata-latin, which is the honest price of the
            feature the stylesheet was already promising.

  calt.     Dropped from JetBrains Mono. That feature is the code-ligature set: it draws
            `=>` as an arrow and `!==` as a struck-through equals WITH NO EXCLAMATION MARK
            ON SCREEN. Fine in an editor where you typed the line; wrong on a page where a
            reader copies it. It is also half the file -- 30,164 B to 14,356 B -- and
            --font-mono resolves to this family on every install, so any post with code
            pays for it whatever typeface the owner picked.
