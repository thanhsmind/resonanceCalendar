# Rebuild the seven README plates, from seeded fixtures, in one command.
#
# THE COMMAND IS THE POINT. `compose-demo.ts` was written so the images "regenerate from a
# command rather than an image editor", and then the command itself lived only in whoever
# had last run it: which URLs, at which widths, driven into which state, under which label.
# Reshooting therefore meant reading four JPEGs to work out what they were pictures OF.
# That is this file.

# It seeds two throwaway databases (the list instance and the newspaper one, exactly as the
# demo runs), serves them, drives Chromium through the states a reader has to click for, and
# composes the plates. Nothing here touches a live site.
#
# Env: CHROME / CHROME_HEADLESS_SHELL — the browser binary, as drive.ts and shot.ts expect.

# WHAT THE RENDERER DOES, at a size you can read it at. Three panels, and every number in
# the two lines below was decided by looking at the result rather than by taste:
#
#   • 820 wide, not 1280. At the wider viewport the reading column is 672px in the middle
#     of the frame with a contents rail beside it and air on the right, so the thing the
#     panel is ABOUT ends up a third of the picture. At 820 the rails drop and the column
#     fills it. Not narrower: the point is to see the formula WITH the prose around it.
#   • scale 2, because `compose-demo.ts` composes at 2x and resizes the plate down at the
#     end. A panel shot at 1x goes through that halving too and comes out looking like a
#     screenshot taken from across the room — which is exactly how the first version of
#     this plate was reported.
#
# The maths panel is aimed at the SUM, not at the first formula on the page: the simple
# one is `s_n = s_0 r^n` and it demonstrates nothing a browser could not have done in 1998.
