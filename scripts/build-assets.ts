const BUDGET: Record<string, number> = {
  // Every public page: the beacon, the header's overlays and controls, the grid toggle.
  //
  // Every raise is a DECISION with its cost written down, not a number nudged mid-fix. The
  // headroom is deliberately a few hundred bytes rather than twenty: twenty is not a budget,
  // it is a tripwire, and one accessibility pass went 59 over in a single commit.
  // What the current ceiling bought, most recently: the reader's palette switcher (564 bytes,
  // after the theme and palette menus became one `dropdown()` instead of two), the beacon's
  // engaged-time meter (~240 — wall-clock dwell measured furniture, one tab left open for a
  // day moved the whole site's average by minutes), and the owner's default light/dark (48,
  // read off <body> or the island overrules the paint the stylesheet just made).
  //
  // 10,500 since 2026-08-29, and the 212 bytes it bought are page weight: the leave beacon
  // now sums `transferSize` across Navigation and Resource Timing and sends it, so the
  // owner can see what a page costs a reader from the admin instead of from a network
  // panel. Priced honestly: 212 bytes on every public page, once, gzipped into a bundle
  // that is already fetched, against a post that measures about 100 KB. The measurement
  // could not be taken on the server -- a CDN answers most readers and the origin never
  // sees them -- so the browser is the only place it exists.
  //
  // 11,000 since 2026-08-30, and what it bought is the offline switch (ADR 0039), measured
  // at 676 bytes raw and 235 gzipped against a build with the island removed. Two thirds of
  // that is the half nobody sees: a worker outlives the page that installed it, so the
  // island also has to UNREGISTER one and drop its caches when the owner turns the feature
  // off. Registering alone would have been cheaper and would have made the switch a one-way
  // door. It runs on every public page for the same reason — the switch can only take
  // effect on a page the reader happens to load, and most of those are listings.
  //
  // 11,300 since 2026-09-07, and it bought back page weight many times over. The server used
  // to render EVERY card of the feed and hide the tail, which is why this file had no fetch
  // in it. Measured on the 33-post demo the home page was 49,905 bytes uncompressed, and it
  // grows with the archive: a five-hundred-post blog would have shipped roughly 450 KB on
  // every visit, with the page cache holding a copy per URL. The server now sends three
  // chunks and a link, and this asks for the rest. The net is 491 bytes: the fetch and the
  // year-merge cost more than that, and deleting the hide-and-reveal machinery gave some
  // back. Against it: about 25 KB of HTML off every listing view on a blog of any age, and
  // 0.136 CLS off the phone home page, because nothing on the page moves any more.
  //
  // 11,500 the same day, for the mobile drawer: `role=dialog`, `aria-modal`, `aria-controls`
  // and picking the LAST rail rather than the first. The last one is not decoration — on a
  // two-rail listing the first `.rail` is `display:none` below the breakpoint, so the drawer
  // opened and focus stayed behind it, and Escape restored nothing.
  //
  // 11,800 since 2026-09-13, and it bought a card you can read. Two faults in the scroll
  // fade, both of them about a list that GROWS while it is being read. The fallback for
  // engines with no view() timelines watched the cards the server sent and not the pages
  // fetched after them, so past page one every card was appended already hidden. And on an
  // engine that HAS view() timelines, a range resolved before the list grew is not
  // recomputed after, which leaves a card standing part-way through its own fade with its
  // neighbours solid — reported from Safari, and not reproducible in Chrome, which is the
  // evidence that the declaration is not what differs. The fade is still CSS and still off
  // the main thread; 108 bytes now decide when it is OVER, which no stale range can argue
  // with. Left at 11,500 the next change to this file would have been golf.
  'core.js': 11_800,
  // /{slug}: back to top, code copy, lightbox, subscribe, comments, the ToC highlight and
  // book mode. Same rule as above — each raise is named and priced.
  //
  // The four worth knowing, because each buys something a reader can feel:
  //   book mode's A-/A+ and phone gestures — the type size could not be changed at all, and
  //     both server-rendered doorways hide under 768px, so phones had a book they could not open
  //   the quote gesture (1,302 raw, ~600 gzipped) — a sentence plus a `#:~:text=` fragment,
  //     which needs no account, no third party, and no change in the renderer `golden/` pins
  //   the comment stamp, ADR 0032 (761 bytes) — the best value in this file: the alternative
  //     was Turnstile, an account and ~60 KB from challenges.cloudflare.com on every page with
  //     a form, on a site whose whole claim is zero third-party requests
  //   the reading position (~1.1 KB) — a forty-minute read is never one sitting
  //   the phone's book reader (~1.5 KB) — see below
  //
  // 17,400 since 2026-09-02, and the 227 bytes it bought are the last row of the contents
  // list telling the truth on a desktop (issue #63). The tags and categories exist twice
  // and only one copy is ever on screen: under the article on a phone, in the gutter panel
  // above the rail breakpoint, where the under-article copy is `display:none`. The row is
  // server-rendered pointing at the under-article copy, which is right at one width and
  // sent a desktop reader 2,615px past the end of the prose to an invisible anchor at the
  // other. The server cannot know a viewport width, so the choice has to be made here and
  // re-made on resize. Priced against the alternative of rendering both copies visible,
  // which costs nothing in JavaScript and undoes a deliberate layout.
  //
  // 19,000 since 2026-09-06, and what the 1,600 bought is the phone's own book reader
  // (`book-scroll.ts`). The spread is a modal dialog, and a modal takes the scroll off the
  // document — which on iOS means Safari keeps its address bar and its toolbar for the whole
  // read: 190px of an 844px screen, plus 56 of ours, leaving under 600 for the words and a
  // page turn every four sentences. The phone reader scrolls the DOCUMENT, so those bars
  // retract, and its chrome leaves on the way down and returns on the way up. Priced after
  // the a/A control was made one definition for both readers rather than two (−800 b); what
  // is left is the reader itself, the direction-following chrome, and the back gesture.
  // 19,600 the same day, for the motion engine's script half (assets/js/motion.ts): ONE
  // scroll loop where four islands ran four, with every island's layout reads before any
  // island's class writes, so a scroll frame forces layout once rather than once per
  // island; the gate asked in one place (`motionOn`) so the to-top scroll stops moving when
  // the owner's switch or the reader's OS says so; and `fadeSwap` on the book's page turn,
  // whose timer used to hold a blank spread for 130ms with the switch off because it did
  // not know the transition was gone.
  //
  // 7,400 since 2026-09-06 (evening): book mode and the comment thread left for bundles of
  // their own. They were 7.8 KB and 7.0 KB of the 19.6 KB - three quarters of the file spent
  // on two owner's switches, sent to every reader of a site with both off. What is left is
  // every article's islands: copy, lightbox, contents, quote, resume, to-top.
  'post.js': 7_400,
  // Only on a page whose switch is on (article.ts). Priced with their own copy of `dom` and
  // `motion` (~1.5 KB each): an IIFE cannot share, and a shared chunk would be a request
  // every page pays for two pages' benefit.
  //
  // 7,700 since 2026-09-07, for two things a reader can feel. The reader is a CLONE of the
  // article, so while it was open the document held two of every heading id and every
  // footnote marker: a footnote link landed on whichever copy the browser picked first,
  // which is as often as not the one that is display:none. The clone's anchors are now its
  // own. And the phone reader hides everything outside itself, including the button that
  // opened it, so focus fell to the body: it now follows the reader in and back out.
  //
  // 7,800 since 2026-09-14, for 104 bytes that turn a blink into a page turn. The spread
  // used to cross-fade: out over 150ms, jump, back over 150ms, which is a blink whatever it
  // is called. It slides now (`glide`), and the extra bytes are what makes that correct
  // rather than merely different: the helper reads the flow's LIVE transform, so a turn
  // asked for while one is still running starts from where the pages actually are instead
  // of snapping to the last destination first. A held arrow key is the common case.
  // 7,900 since 2026-09-23, for the copy's pictures to stop promising the lightbox: cloned
  // with the article, each was a Tab stop announcing a dialog nothing would open, and
  // focusing one on a later page scrolled the book off its spread (renameAnchors).
  'book-mode.js': 7_900,
  'comment-thread.js': 6_700,
  // The reader's pen: the selection bar, the anchor maths (a text-quote selector, found
  // again by its surroundings), the store, the note card and the copy gesture it absorbed
  // from post.js. 9,229 at first landing (2026-09-09), about 3.5 KB gzipped, on a page
  // that has already chosen to fetch it; each raise gets named here like the others.
  // 10,600 since the pen learned to send a mark home (ADR 0045): the button, the one-time
  // question for the notebook's address, and the URL the door reads.
  // 13.1 KB with tier two (ADR 0047): the keep panel is twelve labelled controls and the
  // four calls behind them. Loaded on article pages only, and only while the pen is on.
  'reader-pen.js': 13_400,
  // /login only, and NOT loaded with core.js: the sign-in page carries no beacon, no
  // search overlay and no listing controls, so it pays for the reveal toggle, the caps-lock
  // warning and the one-time-code paste, and nothing else.
  'login.js': 1_500,
  // Fetched ONCE per reader per deploy, and never on the page's critical path — so its
  // budget is about keeping it a small, readable thing rather than about page weight. Two
