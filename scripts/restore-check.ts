//
// `bun run tour` proves the archive BUILDS — it reads two bytes and confirms a gzip member.
// That is the cheap half. It cannot tell you the databases inside open, that they hold the
// owner's rows, or that the uploads tree came along, and every one of those has failed
// somewhere in this project's history: a snapshot taken as a file copy captures a torn
// write-ahead log that only reveals itself on restore, and the uploads directory has been read
// from one path and written to another for months with no test going red.
//
// So this opens the archive and checks what a restore would actually get:
//
//   1. the three members are there                — an archive missing uploads/ looks fine
//   2. `pragma integrity_check` on both databases — a torn snapshot fails here and nowhere else
//   3. every row count matches the live instance  — a VACUUM INTO that raced a write does not
//   4. every upload is byte-identical             — the failure mode that has actually bitten
//
// Run against a THROWAWAY instance, which `scripts/ops/tour.sh` hands it. It only reads: live
// databases are opened read-only and the extraction goes under `.tmp/`.
//
//   bun scripts/restore-check.ts http://127.0.0.1:3399

 * this check would still have passed. They were added; then the fediverse, the reader's pen,

 * and tag on the blog, and the only table whose rows vanish by CASCADE — `integration_keys`,
 * which is every credential, and `server_secrets`, which is the salt every analytics visitor
 * identity is built from, so losing it reads as a traffic collapse rather than a bad restore.
