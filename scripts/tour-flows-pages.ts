  // — "lề", "lệ", "lê", "lẻ" and "lễ" — so a search for the first would return all five.

  // TWO HALVES, because they fail differently and in different files. The SERVER must write the

  // ⚠️ A PLANTED ROW, and it is the right instrument rather than a shortcut. The tour fixture is

  // which the half above has just verified on bytes.
