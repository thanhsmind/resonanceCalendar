// The EDITOR's half of the owner tour. Split from `tour-flows-admin.ts` on 2026-08-15, on the
// same seam that file was split from `tour-flows.ts` on and for the same reason: the 400-line
// cap came due, and the cut is by READER rather than by size.
//
// What lives here is every flow that opens `/admin/editor` and drives the FORM — the title
// field, the unsaved marker, the local recovery copy, a save, a publish, a rename. What stays
// next door is the admin's other nine screens, which the editor knows nothing about.
//
// These are the flows that talk to the CLIENT rather than to the API, which is the whole point
// of having them: the rename bug of 2026-08-15 saved the post correctly, answered 200 to every
// request, and still threw the editor away for a red "Not found". No API-level assertion could
// have seen it.
