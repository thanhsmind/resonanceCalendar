// The posts the showcase fixture is built from: the shape of a seeded post and the order they
// arrive in. The words are in the six siblings.
//
// ONE SUBJECT: letterforms and the making of pages. A demo that wanders across five topics
// reads as filler; one that stays on a subject reads as a real publication, and this one can
// talk about the thing the reader is looking at while they look at it.
//
// SEVERAL LANGUAGES, on purpose. The bundled subsets cover latin, latin-ext and vietnamese, so
// tone marks, umlauts, ogoneks, hačeks, dotless i and eth all render in the real face. CJK
// joined them on 2026-08-15 — nothing CJK is SHIPPED, which was the real constraint and has
// not moved; the stacks now name PingFang, Hiragino, Yu Mincho and the Notos before the
// generic, so CJK lands in a decided face at zero download (`seed-content-cjk.ts`).
//
// ONE LINE PER PARAGRAPH: the renderer turns a single newline into a `<br>`.
//
// EVERY POST EARNS ITS PLACE BY SHOWING SOMETHING. This fixture is the only thing a visitor to
// demo.quireink.com sees, so a renderer feature absent from it is one the demo claims and
// never proves. It went up with no code fence and no table anywhere, which is how a site that
// renders maths, code and tables came to look like a site that renders paragraphs.
//
// THE SPLIT IS BY CATEGORY, except `-intl` and `-cjk` (by LANGUAGE, since those posts exist to
// prove the subsets) and `-page` (by SERIES). Everything splits at the 400-line cap.
