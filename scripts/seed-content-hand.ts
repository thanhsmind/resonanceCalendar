    body: `Vincent van Gogh wrote more than nine hundred letters that survive, most of them to his brother Theo, and he wrote the Arles ones with the same instrument he was drawing with: a reed, cut to a broad edge with a pocket knife.[^1] Not a metaphorically similar instrument — ++the same pen, dipped in the same ink++, moving between a sentence and a @@sketch@@ without being put down.

That makes the letters something rare. Formal calligraphy shows you what a broad edge does when someone is being careful. ==The letters show what it does when someone is thinking about something else entirely==#blue — and the tool's behaviour survives the neglect, which is the whole argument for learning tools rather than styles.

## A pen you make in a minute

A reed pen is the oldest broad-edged instrument there is: a length of dried reed, cut at an angle, slit once so it holds a drop of ink. Scribes wrote with it for two thousand years before the quill displaced it in Europe, and it never stopped being used where reeds grow — which includes the marshes around Arles.

![Self-portrait, 1889. The beard is drawn in the same directional strokes the reed makes on paper](/uploads/media/van-gogh-self-portrait.jpg#left-third)

Van Gogh cut his own, in several widths, and complained happily about them in the letters. The reed suited him for the reason it frustrates beginners: it holds little ink and gives it up fast, so every stroke starts wet and ends @@dry@@. A careful writer fights that. He harvested it — ++the fading stroke became texture, distance, wind in a field++.

The floated portrait beside this paragraph is the size feature doing its job, incidentally: a figure at thirty per cent of the column, with the prose running around it, is how a magazine sets a face — and how a letter sets a sketch.

## The page is composed, even when the words are not

Look at the 1885 letter above rather than reading it — it is sitting on a mat, the way a facsimile is shown, which is a per-picture choice and not something done to the scan. The lines are dense and even, the left margin never wavers, and when a sketch arrives it is set into the measure like a figure in a book — The Potato Eaters, months before the painting, sitting between two paragraphs as if a compositor had placed it.

Nobody taught him that as a rule. It is what a person who looks at pages all day does by reflex, and it is the same reflex this software's figure placement is trying to give back to people who write on glass.

![The bedroom at Arles, drawn with the reed pen inside a letter to Theo, October 1888](/uploads/media/van-gogh-bedroom-letter-sketch.jpg)

## The sketch travels ahead of the painting

The bedroom drawing above went to Theo in October 1888, in the middle of a letter, days before the canvas was finished. The strokes are pure reed: the floorboards are single confident pulls that thin as the pen dries, the walls are hatched at one consistent angle, and every object keeps the wobble of a line drawn once and not corrected.

Put the paintings beside the letters and the pen is still visible under the paint. The same directional stroke, the same refusal to go back over a line — brushwork by a hand trained on a broad edge:

## Three pens, one lesson

| Pen | Cut from | Ink held | The line it wants |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reed | cane, by hand | a drop | short, emphatic, drying |
| Quill | a flight feather | a sentence | long, flexible, fine |
| Steel nib | pressed metal | a paragraph | uniform, tireless |

The table explains the letters' texture better than any stylistic analysis. A quill hand flows because the tool flows; a reed hand punches because the tool runs out. ==Choose the tool and you have chosen most of the style==#green — which is the first lesson of the broad-edged pen, arriving here from a man who would have been baffled to be called a calligrapher.

    excerpt: 'Nearly every serif on your screen is a frozen record of a flat nib held at an angle. Hold a pen at thirty degrees, write an O, and the thick and thin you get is the same modulation a type designer spends a year redrawing.',

    body: `Pick up a broad-edged pen, hold it at thirty degrees, and write an **o**. The stroke is thick on the down-left and thin on the up-right, and you did nothing to make it so: the nib is a flat edge, and ++the width of the mark is simply how much of that edge is facing the direction you are travelling++.

==That single fact explains most of what a serif typeface looks like.==#yellow The thick and thin of a Garamond, the axis its round letters lean on, the way the join between bowl and stem thins to nothing — none of it is decoration. It is a record of a tool.

## The angle is the style

Hold the pen flatter and the contrast moves: you get the upright, heavy-footed look of an uncial. Hold it steeper and you approach the diagonal stress of an italic. Change nothing but the angle and the letterform changes family.

![The same stroke at three nib angles: flatten the pen and the weight sits upright, steepen it and the stress turns diagonal](/uploads/media/nib-angles.png)

This is why type designers still learn to write with a pen even though nobody sets books with one. The pen teaches which parts of a letter are structural and which are habit.

## One tool, four hands

The angle is not the only dial, but it is the master one. Hold everything else steady and walk the angle through history:

| Nib angle | Hand | Stress | Feel |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 0–15° | Uncial | vertical | round, archaic, slow |
| 30° | Foundational, Carolingian | near-vertical | the workhorse |
| 40° | Chancery italic | diagonal | quick, warm |
| 45°+ | Gothic textura | strong diagonal | dense, woven |

Read the table downward and you are reading a thousand years of European writing, in order, as a single wrist rotation. Every row is also a typeface family you can name — which is the point: the families did not invent their stress, they inherited it.

## What the pen cannot teach

It cannot teach spacing. A calligrapher spaces by feel, one letter at a time, and every line is different. A typeface has to space every possible pair in advance, forever, without knowing what will sit next to what.

That is the jump from writing to type, and it is a much larger jump than drawing the letters.

## Trying it without any equipment

You do not need a nib to feel this. Tape two pencils together, hold them at a steady angle, and write your name slowly. The double line the points draw is the ribbon a broad edge lays down, and every widening and thinning arrives on its own, without a single decision from you.

Now rotate your grip a little and write the name again. The letters are recognisably yours and recognisably different — heavier here, leaner there — and you have just performed, in thirty seconds, the experiment that separates one historical hand from another.

Do it a third time faster and watch the joins start to slur. That slurring, disciplined over a few centuries, is where italic came from. The history of Western letterforms is substantially a history of people in a hurry, and the pen records the hurry as faithfully as it records the angle.`,

    ago: 71,
    body: `Uncial is what happens when a formal alphabet meets a pen that prefers curves. Roman capitals were cut in stone, and their straight strokes and sharp corners are a chisel's preferences. Move the same alphabet onto vellum with a broad nib and the corners round off, because rounding is faster and the pen resists the turn.

The result, from about the fourth century, is a hand of wide round letters with almost no ascenders or descenders, written between two lines rather than four.[^1] It is unmistakable and it is slow: an uncial page is a page somebody spent a week on.

## Half-uncial is where lower case comes from

Half-uncial let the strokes run above and below the writing line. The **b**, **d**, **h** and **l** grew ascenders; the **p** and **q** grew descenders. That is the moment the two-case alphabet becomes possible, several centuries before anyone treated the cases as different alphabets rather than different formalities.[^2]

![The Chi Rho page of the Book of Kells, where three Greek letters take a whole page of insular half-uncial ornament](/uploads/media/kells-chi-rho.jpg#right-third)

Insular half-uncial — the Irish and Northumbrian variety, the hand of the Book of Kells — pushed it furthest, and it is where the shape of our **g** was settled.

## Reading a real page

The folio beside this paragraph is the most famous page of the most famous half-uncial book: the Chi Rho monogram of Kells, where the text of Matthew reaches the name of Christ and the scribe stops writing and starts building. Three letters — chi, rho, iota — swallow the page.

Look past the ornament at the small text worked into it and the hand is exactly what the exercise below teaches: a flat angle, wide bowls, and that decisive round **e** and low-slung **g**. The spectacular page and the practice page are the same hand at two speeds, and it is more useful to study the ordinary lines than the initial — the ordinary lines are the ones a scribe could keep up for three hundred folios.

## Writing one

Nib angle very flat, between five and fifteen degrees, which is the whole difference from every later hand. Keep the letters wide: an uncial **o** is a full circle, not the oval an italic wants. Resist the urge to add slope. There is none.

==The hard part is not the letterforms, it is the pace.==#orange Uncial punishes speed in a way a running hand does not, because every curve is a slow, even turn and any hesitation shows as a flat spot on the arc.

## What it is good for now

Very little, honestly, and that is fine. It is the clearest way to feel what a nib angle *does*, because at five degrees the tool's behaviour is exaggerated to the point of being obvious. Ninety minutes of uncial teaches more about stress and contrast than a week of reading about them.

[^1]: The name is from Jerome, who used *uncialibus litteris* dismissively — roughly "inch-high letters" — complaining about scribes wasting vellum on show. The name for the hand comes from a complaint about it.
[^2]: Mixing the cases as a matter of grammar rather than display is Carolingian, and later still. For centuries a scribe chose a hand for the whole page, not a case for the word.`,

    ago: 79,
    body: `Cancellaresca, the chancery hand of sixteenth-century Rome, is the ancestor of every italic on your screen. It is also, unusually for a calligraphic hand, learnable in an afternoon, because almost all of it is built from four shapes.

## The four shapes

The first is a slightly compressed **o**, an oval rather than a circle, leaning about five degrees. Everything round in the hand comes from it.

The second is the **branching arch** of the **n**, which leaves the stem low, about a third up from the baseline, and curves out. Get the branch too high and you have a roman **n** in a hurry.

The third is the **a**, which is the oval with a stem. The fourth is the entry and exit stroke, the small diagonal that joins one letter to the next and gives the hand its slope and its speed.

Four shapes carry the whole alphabet, and the division of labour is worth writing out, because it is also a practice order:

| Shape | Builds | Practise until |
|---|---|---|
| The oval **o** | o c e d g q b p | the two halves match |
| The arch of **n** | n m h r u (inverted) | the branch leaves low |
| The **a** | a d g q u | the bowl closes, the stem lands |
| Entry / exit | every join, i l t | the diagonal is one angle |

An hour on the first two rows is worth more than an afternoon on the alphabet in order, because **s**, **k** and **z** — the letters outside the system — will always look wrong until the system letters look right.

## The angle, and the only rule that matters

Nib angle around forty degrees, slope around five to ten. ==Then keep both constant.==#green A page of chancery with a wandering slope looks worse than a page of a clumsier hand held steady, because the eye reads inconsistency long before it reads quality.

## Why bother

Because writing the letters teaches you where an italic's weight sits, and after ninety minutes you will never again mistake a slanted roman for an italic. One is a hand. The other is a transformation matrix.`,

    title: 'Ruling a page before you write on it',

    category: 'Calligraphy', tags: ['practice', 'layout', 'craft'],
    ago: 88,
    body: `Every formal hand is ruled before a single letter is written, and the ruling is not a matter of taste. It is derived from the nib, because the nib is the only fixed quantity on the desk.

## The unit is the nib width

Lay the pen flat on the page and step it, corner over corner, up the sheet. ==Each step is one **nib width**==#green, and every vertical measurement in the hand is a count of them. The x-height of a foundational hand is four nib widths; an uncial is about three and a half; a chancery italic is five.

That is why the same hand written with a wider nib is not just larger — it is identically proportioned, which is a stronger guarantee than any point size gives you.

## The arithmetic

For a nib of width $n$ and a hand whose x-height is $k$ nib widths, with ascenders and descenders each $a$ nib widths beyond it, the line height needs

$$\\ell = n\\,(k + 2a) + g$$

where $g$ is the gap you leave between the descenders of one line and the ascenders of the next. Set $g = 0$ and the lines interlock — legible, and used deliberately in some manuscript hands, but not what a beginner is aiming for.

| Hand | x-height ($k$) | Extenders ($a$) | Line height at $n = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Foundational | 4 | 3 | 20 mm + gap |
| Uncial | 3.5 | 1 | 11 mm + gap |
| Chancery italic | 5 | 4 | 26 mm + gap |
| Gothic textura | 5 | 2 | 18 mm + gap |

## Why the gap is the interesting number

Because it is the only free variable, and it is the one that decides whether a page reads as dense or as airy. Everything else is dictated by the nib. A scribe changing the feel of a page is almost always changing $g$ and nothing else — which is the same move as changing the leading and leaving the type size alone.

## Rule in pencil, and rule the verticals too

Two vertical lines for the text block's edges, and one more a nib width outside the left one, because ascenders and capitals overhang and a hard left edge on every line looks mechanical. Then erase nothing. A ruled line still faintly visible under the writing is what a manuscript page is supposed to look like.`,
