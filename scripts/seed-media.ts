// Six plates for the media library, drawn rather than downloaded.
//
// Media is the one admin screen that cannot be filled with prose, so it stayed a drop zone and
// an empty-state message through every screenshot the project has taken — while the responsive
// pipeline behind it was the part nobody could see working.
//
// GEOMETRY ONLY, NO TEXT. sharp renders `<text>` through the HOST's font stack, and this seeder
// runs on the demo server during `refresh.sh` — a 1 GB box with no reason to have a serif
// installed. A plate with text would look right where it was written and come out blank where
// anyone looks at it. Every mark here is a rect, a circle or a path.
//
// ⚠️ DETERMINISTIC NAMES, AND DELETED FIRST. `writeUniqueOriginal` claims names with an
// exclusive write and falls through to `-2`, `-3` on collision. The database is wiped on every
// reseed but the blob store is not, so without the delete the library fills with the same
// picture eight times.
//
// ⚠️ That determinism is also what makes the demo's TWO instances safe, and nothing at the call
// site hints at it: `refresh.sh` seeds two databases, and neither unit sets
// `STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR`, so both default to `./uploads` under one shared working directory. One
// blob store, two seeds, back to back. It works only because the second seed deletes and
// rewrites the SAME paths the first wrote, leaving the first database's rows resolving. Give
// these files a random suffix and the newspaper instance 404s every thumbnail, silently.
// (The window where a path is deleted and not yet rewritten is unreachable: `refresh.sh` stops
// both units before seeding.)
