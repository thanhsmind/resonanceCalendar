# Quire Ink

Public, source-available blog platform (PolyForm Noncommercial, [ADR 0015](./docs/decisions/0015-relicense-polyform-noncommercial.md);
unmodified releases may be run commercially, [ADR 0023](./docs/decisions/0023-commercial-use-of-unmodified-releases.md); it opens by itself after 48 months without a release, [ADR 0050](./docs/decisions/0050-the-licence-opens-by-itself-after-48-months-without-a-release.md)).
One **Bun + Hono + SQLite** process; `src/` at the repository root serves the live site.

**Zero personal data in this repo.** No IP, user, port or host, ever: they live in the private
sibling with the worklog, the tasks and the audits; credentials only in the gitignored `.env`.
But before proposing `docs/`, `scripts/` or `golden/` for that sibling, the second test:
**if it vanished, could a stranger still install this and verify what they installed?** If no
it is the PRODUCT and stays — the private deploy script ships `scripts/` and the tests read `golden/`.

## Verify

```
bun run check:all
```

Typecheck, the fourteen static guards (`filesize` · `css` · `nul` · `routes` · `type` · `admin-kit` ·
`bundle` · `contract` · `docs` · `motion` · `i18n` · `deps` · `admin-css` · `admin-wired`) and
`bun test`. ~2 min; a change under `src/md`, `src/render` or `src/web` also runs the golden compare.

`check:all` proves the code compiles and the seams hold. It cannot tell you a column
collapsed to `reader@e…` or that three columns are 14px out of alignment. Both shipped,
because nobody opened the page. **CI runs the tour below on every push**, so a change to
anything rendered goes red there if it was pushed on `check:all` alone (2026-09-11, twice).

```
bun run tour
```

Every flow in a real browser, each with a verdict: the reader's controls, every admin page, a
draft saved and published and trashed and restored, an upload refused for being too large, the
archive built. It seeds its own instance on **port 3399** and deletes it after, and refuses to
start if the port is taken (a tour on a busy port tours the wrong instance and fails every admin
flow). `PORT=` moves it. Flows live in [`scripts/tour-flows.ts`](./scripts/tour-flows.ts); the
browser plumbing is [`scripts/tour.ts`](./scripts/tour.ts).

It then runs [`scripts/restore-check.ts`](./scripts/restore-check.ts), because a browser
cannot untar an archive or open a SQLite file. The tour proves the backup BUILDS; this opens
it — `integrity_check` on both databases, no table with fewer rows than before the snapshot except the rebuildable ones it skips on purpose,
every upload byte-identical. A backup nobody has restored is not a backup.

For one page, looked at rather than asserted: [`scripts/drive.ts`](./scripts/drive.ts) and
[`scripts/shot.ts`](./scripts/shot.ts). Verify against the **origin**, never through the CDN.

**Do not read `CHANGELOG.md` while coding.** It is append-only at release time and its
history is never needed to fix or understand code.

## Debug router — a symptom, and the files to open first

| Symptom / area | Read these first |
|---|---|
| Routing, middleware, what a request does | `src/web/app.ts`, `src/web/guard.ts`, `src/web/cache-headers.ts` |
| Cache, or content not updating | `src/server/cache.ts` (in-process), `src/web/cache-headers.ts` (shared), `src/server/edge-cache.ts` |
| A page's HTML | `src/web/{layout,chrome,article,listing}.ts`, `src/web/*.css.ts` |
| Markdown → HTML, the editor's document, the excerpt · highlighting, footnotes · the pen | `src/md/` (the engine, ADR 0052; one import out, held by `src/md/boundary.test.ts`) · `src/render/` · `src/pen/` (self-contained, door at `src/pen/index.ts`) |
| Island JS: search, theme, comments, subscribe, book mode | `src/assets/js/` |
| Admin screens, the editor | `src/web/admin/` (the markup the server draws), `src/admin/` (the browser half: `island/` and the editor), `src/admin-shared/` (what both sides read) |
| Sign-in, TOTP, sessions, recovery codes | `src/auth/`, `src/web/auth-routes.ts`, `src/web/enrol-routes.ts` (first run) |
| Posts, pages, slugs, series, revisions, settings | `src/content/` |
| Uploads, image variants, ranges | `src/media/` |
| Newsletter, broadcast, SMTP | `src/news/` |
| Comments · Analytics | `src/comments/` · `src/analytics/` (writes go through `buffer.ts`) |
| SQL, migrations, the live/trashed predicate | `src/store/` |
| Scheduled publishing, redirects, rate limit, activity | `src/server/` |
| MCP server, tokens · the read-only Content API | `src/mcp/`, `src/web/admin/mcp-transport.ts`, `src/web/admin/mcp.ts` · `src/web/api-v1.ts` |
| UI strings, translations | `src/i18n/`, `locales/` (repo root, so translators can find it) |
| Imports (WordPress/Ghost/…), image rescue | `src/import/`, `src/web/admin/ops.ts` |

## Hard rules — each one is a bug that already shipped

- **NEVER quote the owner** — not in code, comments, docs, ADRs, tests or commit messages.
  State the fact or the measurement. Vietnamese in the tree is only ever a UI string, a test
  fixture or seed content.
- **No `any`** — use `unknown` and narrow. Acceptable only at a JSON boundary that
  immediately validates into a typed shape.
- **No VALUE is ever interpolated into SQL.** Values are bound, always. Only a fixed
  IDENTIFIER from a module constant or a closed set may be — a column list (`META_COLS`), the
  `liveOnly()` predicate, a table name, the analytics facet
  ([`docs/spec/01-schema-port.md`](./docs/spec/01-schema-port.md) §3). A handful of such sites, none reads a
  request.
- **Every write route is mounted on the owner-gated router group**, not checked inside the
  handler ([invariant 4](./docs/invariants.md)).
- **Every handler** times and logs its request, catches errors, and returns a typed error.
- **Secrets never reach a client-bound payload**: `users.password_hash`, `users.totp_secret`,
  `recovery_codes`, `integration_keys`, `mcp_tokens`.
- **Public UI colours come ONLY from theme tokens.** Never a hardcoded `neutral-*`, `white`,
  `black` or hex. ONE typeface, no hardcoded sizes, one divider style, never ALL-CAPS.
- **UI strings live in `locales/` only** (repo root), every language in sync — the compiler enforces the keys; `locales/langs.ts` is the list.

## Danger zones

- **`golden/v1/corpus/` is the golden compare's contract**, read by `src/render/golden.test.ts`
  on every run. **Never regenerate it:** those files are what 1.x actually printed, from a
  renderer that no longer exists, so overwriting them does not update the reference — it
  destroys it, and the gate then reports parity against our own output. When output changes on
  purpose, name the fixture in `DIVERGED` in that test and capture the new answer under
  `golden/v2/corpus/`; the rest keep the original contract.
- **The retired Next.js implementation is gone from the tree** ([ADR 0019](./docs/decisions/0019-remove-the-frozen-tree-from-the-working-copy.md)),
  preserved at tag `v1-final`. Do not reintroduce it, and do not "fix" a doc by pointing at
  a `v1/` path.
- **Production is not a test environment.** A newsletter cannot be unsent.
- **All scratch goes under `.tmp/`** — one gitignored root, never a new one at the root.
