# Quire Ink on a fresh Ubuntu droplet (tested against Ubuntu 24.04).
#
# Paste this whole file into "Advanced Options -> Add Initialization scripts"
# on DigitalOcean's droplet-create page (the box is free), pick the cheapest
# droplet, and create it. About three minutes after boot the blog is serving
# on http://<droplet-ip> and the one-time link that claims it is waiting in
# /root/quire-claim.txt -- also in `docker logs quire`, where every restart
# prints a fresh one.
#
# Plain HTTP against the bare IP is the most a machine with no domain can
# honestly do. When you point a domain at the droplet, the reverse-proxy
# section of docs/self-host.md (or docker-compose.caddy.yml) upgrades it to
# HTTPS, and Settings -> Blog moves the address with you.
set -euo pipefail

# ── THE ONE LINE WORTH EDITING BEFORE YOU PASTE THIS ──────────────────────────
# Put your domain here and the droplet comes up on HTTPS, with the certificate
# already issued: Caddy in front, Let's Encrypt, nothing scheduled. The domain
# has to ALREADY point at this droplet, which means creating the A record with
# the reserved IP before the droplet, or pasting this again afterwards.
#
# Leave it empty and you get what this file has always given: the blog on port
# 80 at the droplet's own address, no certificate, and a note in
# /root/quire-https.txt with the one command that fixes it once DNS is ready.
#
# SETUP_CODE is the second line worth filling: twelve characters or more, and
# the blog is claimed by opening /setup in a browser and typing them, so the
# terminal is never needed. Leave it empty and the one-time link in the log
# is the way in, as before. https://quireink.com/start writes both lines.

This blog is on http:// at the droplet's address, because no domain was named
when it booted. To give it HTTPS once DNS points here:

  cd /opt/quire 2>/dev/null || mkdir -p /opt/quire && cd /opt/quire
  RAW=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joiha-steven/quireink/main
  curl -fsSL -o docker-compose.image.yml "$RAW/docker-compose.image.yml"
  curl -fsSL -o Caddyfile "$RAW/Caddyfile"
  printf 'SITE_URL=https://example.com\n' > .env      # your domain
  docker stop quire && docker rm quire                 # frees port 80
  docker compose -f docker-compose.image.yml pull
  docker compose -f docker-compose.image.yml up -d

The data volumes above are bind mounts, so the blog keeps its posts across that
swap. Then change the address in Settings -> Blog to match.
